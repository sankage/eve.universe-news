# Tunir Tash-Murkon
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/tunir-tash-murkon

Tunir Tash-Murkon is the current heir of  House [Tash-Murkon](4t1KEOTA8LvYIHDcOtIPAb). A market analyst and affable diplomat, he has had a considerable amount of experience working with [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) and the other Empires. Tunir believes that [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4) can capitalize on its increasing standing as an economic capital.

Early Life
----------

Born YC17 Tunir was 16 years old when his grandmother, Mehta, was exiled
from their home on Tash Murkon Prime in YC33 to oversee the Somi
constellation. This decree from Davit Tash-Murkon was in response to
Mehta speaking against him after her husband, the previous heir, had
overlooked their own son in favour of Davit as his replacement.
Following the fallout from her grievance her whole branch were sent to
the Nafomeh system. As a teen Tunir would resent the fact that he had
been uprooted from friends, comfort and privilege as a result of his
grandmother's actions. As he grew he would often antagonise her and his
father, Shamel, who he also blamed for not being fit for the role of
heir. He and his younger siblings, a brother and sister, would soon set
out to be the sort of businessmen and leaders that would redeem their
family and ensure their return to the core worlds.

After graduating he worked with [Hedion University](32yJYVHiayBqLEZq4ulJrd) for many years in their
efforts to develop new economic models and update imperial practices in
light of expanding interstellar trade. In particular, Tunir set about
establishing ties with corporate entities in the Somi constellation and
quickly became popular with commercial representatives both inside and
outside the Empire. He impressed with his insights and demeanour but
truly made a name for himself when he oversaw the establishment of a
relationship between [Nurtura](2TUdFyj9jYOLLT0VDlIctC) and [TransStellar Shipping](6H2gOgexrSym6Oy0bxTnf6). After the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) were brought into the space Tunir secured a deal that would ensure that Amarr foodstuffs would be shipped and sold to Federation consumers for several decades.

Excited by the prospect of negotiating further business ties between the
Amarr and other Empires and the profits it could bring Tunir started
approaching corporations in all Empires. He was present for the
negotiations that led to both [Core Complexion Inc.](u4esGMynVEZ2DaTh3uuiY) entering Amarr space and [Joint Harvesting](7JqEMWSt48zSrlssI8zHz0) entering [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) territories. In light of his efforts and movements he was eventually approached by CONCORD. He was soon working with them and stated that it was not only a way to gain standing
outside the influence of the feudalistic houses but start on the road to
fostering a truly universal marketplace. He would eventually be
appointed the Amarr representative in the Secure Commerce Commision. In
this role he was involved in drafting directives controlling how
particular blueprints were to be distributed amongst corporate entities.
One of these would become CONCORD Directive Alpha Gamma 12.

Heir Presumptive
----------------

As tensions rose between the Empires in YC110, Tunir decided to leave
CONCORD and return to the Throne Worlds. He was brought to Amarr as a
consultant in the Oris Emperor Family station. In this facility, Tunir
evaluated and reported on capsuleer trade in Amarr and provided advice
for how best to reinvest its significant profits.

This position also placed him close to the Imperial Court, which made
him a valuable confidante to [Catiz Tash-Murkon](5sw0sEytwzlBUbKWdiisUI). 
He is said to be her first port of call on visiting Oris, if he has not met her shuttle
himself in Dam-Torsad, and he will regularly update her on the political
and economic situation of the Throne Worlds. In the past few years Tunir
has even served as Catiz's proxy on the Privy Council, and he has become
a far more regular presence in the Tash-Murkon domain as well. This, and
his prominent visibility in influential Amarr society, frequently fueled
speculation as to his potential to succeed Catiz as Heir.

Catiz Tash-Murkon herself has indicated Tunir as her preferred successor
both for his great experience in international trade and to bridge past
divisions in the house. As a token of this, she appointed Tunir to the
position of First Trade Lord for the Tash-Murkon Family. The fact that
he has also spent years managing capsuleer trade and contributing to SCC
regulations positions Tunir uniquely to helm the corporate juggernaut
that drives the Tash-Murkon Family. He has acknowledged that capsuleers
are becoming a significant power, if only economically, and that the
heir will need an understanding of the impact they're having. He has
become very interested in establishing the Amarr as the most significant
provider for the burgeoning capsuleer powers.

Royal Heir-elect
----------------

The Tash-Murkon family council surprised some observers of the usually
fractious Royal House by swiftly confirming Tunir Tash-Murkon as the
Royal Heir-elect on Catiz's recommendation ahead of the Imperial
Succession of YC118 trials. More astute watchers of Tash-Murkon house
politics noted that Tunir's proven ability to increase profits was
always likely to provide a strong unifying potential for the
commerce-oriented leadership of the family.
