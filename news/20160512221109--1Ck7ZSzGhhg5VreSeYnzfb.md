The first Capsuleer-assembled Fortizar Citadels have arrived in New Eden, and with them, a whole new round of conflict and controversy.

The title of first onlined Fortizar Citadel goes to [Hard Knocks Inc.](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Hard_Knocks_Inc.) for onlining the Hard Knocks Rental Office on May 5th located in the wormhole with the signature [J115405](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/J115405), codenamed "RAGE".

The _Fortizar_ is Upwell 's large Citadel. Unlike its medium sized counterpart, [the Astrahus](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/interstellar-correspondents/first-capsuleer-citadels-cause-turmoil-across-new-eden/), the Fortizar model is capable of housing full Capital-sized vessels and is designed to be a primary base of operations for a medium to large alliance.

While the Fortizar Citadels have caused fewer conflicts overall than the smaller Astrahus Citadels, Pandemic Horde's newly-onlined "Pillow Fortizar" was hotly contested but successfully onlined against Imperium forces and Interceptor fleets.

[The first ever Fortizar-class Citadel getting destroyed](https://zkillboard.com/kill/53914509/#comments) fell victim to Hard Knocks Inc. in the wormhole system of [J104859](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/J104859), on 11 May.

Meanwhile, [Capsuleer controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4iuspx/upwell_consortium_shady_as_hell/) has begun circling the Upwell Consortium as concerns about their nonchalant and arguably opportunist attitude in regards to the Citadels - in spite of the thousands of colonists killed in the conflicts - has begun to disturb even some of the immortal Capsuleers.
