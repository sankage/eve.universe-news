# Monk Dubois
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/monk-dubois

**Monk Dubois** is an individual of questionable character often
involved in shady encounters and back-handed double-deals usually
involving theft of corporation wealth. He was once a member of [Mordu's Legion](2LwE4Y9GGMmnGQiVhDNd4a). Despite his experience and ability
to adapt to nearly any situation, Monk is haunted by vagaries of his
nervous system, including a sweaty upper lip, rogue twitches, and freak
stutters which betray introspection regarding the morality of the
actions he takes. On more than one occasion this flaw in his facade has
nearly ruined deals and sent him scrambling for his life. He flies a
frigate called "Bad Ike's Rumour".

Monk was contacted by the [Broker](35XiT6V98vAeV9AdpZyl72) during an
attempt to steal funds from a corporation. Much to his bewilderment, the
Broker foiled Monk's original plans, arranging instead for his capture
by the corporation yet also ensuring he would later be able to escape.
Monk only realized the man who interrupted him was the Broker when he
caught sight of the man's name tag, which read "N LEUTRE", or Niques
Leutre, also known as Aeron Assis.
