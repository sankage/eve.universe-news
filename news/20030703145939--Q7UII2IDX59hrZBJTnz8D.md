# New Superhighway system up and running!

Under the leadership of CONCORD a new superhighway system has been constructed to link distant parts of the empires together. The hub of the new highway system is in the Yulai system, the location of the CONCORD Headquarters. From there space travelers are in easy reach of every empire region in just 2 or 3 jumps. All systems that are part of the highway network have a beefed-up security, so using the highway network offers a secure and comfortable way to travel. The superhighway network grid is still in its experimental stages, so people are advised to show caution while using them. Downtimes and operational failures are to be expected. To compensate, using the highway gates will be free of charge until all problems have been ironed out.
