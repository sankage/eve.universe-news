The price of megacyte has been steadily rising in the past few weeks. This is due to the increased difficulty that miners have with finding the rare asteroids that yield the rock.  
  
Bistot, the main source for the megacyte on the market now, seems to be depleted in large areas of space, with only tiny pieces of the rare rocks being discovered. The result is that megacyte is now often sold for more than 10 000 isk per unit.  
  
That is not to say that they are completely unavailable - enterprising companies, as well as those who are based deep in the relatively unexplored fringes of the galaxy, are still providing empire space with megacyte every day...at the aformentioned prices. Many industrialists fear that they may have to cut down entire production lines unless they can find a way to compensate.
