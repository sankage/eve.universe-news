Yulai - A system-wide panic is developing in the Yulai System since the re-appearance of the Minmatar-Thukker armada. Wave after wave of civilian ships have been spotted leaving spaceports all over the solar system, ignoring CONCORD instructions to stay clear of the locked-down stargates in their bid to escape.

CONCORD Bureau Station is so far the only station that has initiated a full lockdown - all other stations have tasked docking controllers to handle departing vessels only, as it seems that every spaceship captain in the Yulai System is trying to avoid being caught up in a sudden fire-fight. The Yulai System is close to mass panic fuelled by speculation, uncertainty and fear.
