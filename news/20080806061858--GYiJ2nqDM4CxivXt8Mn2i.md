The search for the Ammatar scientist downed on a habitable moon in Huola continues. The search team believes it is on the right track, as it recently discovered a day-old camp site they believe was used by Karnell. The camp site shows indications that he managed to procure a small amount of water and has a fair supply of food rations.

A search of the area produced tracks that the rescue team is continuing to follow. Orbital scans revealed a small lake twenty kilometers north of the camp site. The rescue team believes Karnell may be heading there.

Further updates will be made as they become available.
