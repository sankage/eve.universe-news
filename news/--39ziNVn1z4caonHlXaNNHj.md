**Farokh Khanid** is a member of the Amarr Empire's Privy Council.

Early Life
----------

The early life of Farokh Khanid is cloaked in mystery and is bound
up with the chaotic aftermath of the foundation of the
[Khanid Kingdom](khanid-kingdom), following the rebellion of
[Garkeh Khanid](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf) against Emperor [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV).
Farokh was the only child of Reza Khanid,
a first cousin of Garkeh who initially sided with Dakos Khanid in the
brief civil war that took place within the Khanid Kingdom when the
King's brother rebelled.

The failure of Dakos's rebellion led to many members of the Khanid
Family being held as palace hostages to stave off future threats to
Garkeh's rule. Reza Khanid was given his life by Garkeh in order to
avoid further breaches within the family but was made the main hostage
from that branch of House Khanid. Following this, the life of Reza
Khanid becomes obscure other than brief notices in the public records of
the Khanid Kingdom. Reza's marriage to Ellyria Qos an-Khanid, another
family hostage, is recorded as taking place in 23047 AD, followed by the
birth of a child, Farokh, in 23049 AD.

Brought up and held in the cloistered and stifling atmosphere of the
hostage wings of the Royal Palace, Farokh was an obscure figure for
almost a century before he was made Duke of Sib, an important
constellation standing across one of the approaches to the nullsec
region of Querious. This appointment coincided with his release from
hostage status and elevation to the Royal Court proper of King Khanid
II.

Duke of Sib
-----------

As holder of the important Duchy of Sib, Farokh has been responsible for
overseeing all trade and logistics operations through his territory,
together with maintaining a stable tax base to support Royal Khanid Navy
operations in the area. While Farokh has spent most of his time at the
heart of the Kingdom's court, he regularly visits his stronghold in Ashi
system. The Duke is on the Board of Holders of Khanid Transport and is
believed to be one of the wealthiest holders in the Khanid Kingdom.

Now over 300 years old, and having been Duke of Sib for over two
centuries, Farokh Khanid is one of the most powerful men in the Khanid
Kingdom and is a major pillar of King Khanid II's power structure. When
Garkeh Khanid noted the gathering power of one of his admirals, [Zidarez Tol-Jikar](16y8afnfFyguNbuYObbcYl), his counter-play was to send an
ultimatum that eventually led to the arranged marriage of Zidarez to
Farokh, inducting her into the Khanid Family. As Zidarez Khanid was
subsequently made Grand Admiral, the effect of such a marriage was to
concentrate military and economic power in the hands of two of the most
powerful people in Khanid's royal court. Quite why Garkeh Khanid trusts
his cousin so much is unclear but Farokh, for his part, has done nothing
to indicate an attitude other than total loyalty to the crown of Khanid.

Despite his advanced age, Farokh appears to share with his sovereign
cousin the Khanid family trait of responding well to gerontological
implants and has aged very handsomely indeed. The family resemblance to
Garkeh has been remarked upon by many, although this has often been in
the context of ironic comments as to how the even older Garkeh appears
to almost be the same age as Farokh.

Regent and Royal Heir-elect
---------------------------

Shortly after the death of Empress [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L), King
Khanid II elevated Farokh Khanid to the chair of his Royal Council.
Though not a significant promotion for Farokh in itself, the practical
effect was to make the Duke of Sib the chamberlain of the Khanid
Kingdom.

When the Imperial Succession process reached the stage of preparing for
the Trials of the Champions, the King was obliged to name a Royal
Heir-elect by Pomik Haromi, Court Chamberlain of the Amarr Empire.
Garkeh Khanid chose to nominate Farokh as his Heir-elect and even went
so far as to declare Farokh the Regent of the Kingdom in his absence.
