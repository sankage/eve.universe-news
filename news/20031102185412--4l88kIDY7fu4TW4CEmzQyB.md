Tenerhaddi Dykon, head of the Krusual Tribe, issued the following statement just minutes after the identity of the new Amarr Emperor, Doriam Kor-Azor, was announced. "I call upon Doriam Kor-Azor to put a stop to the Amarr raids upon our outlying systems. We Minmatar can no longer stand passive as our homes are destroyed, our families murdered, and our kin are again bound by the cruel yoke of slavery. Never again I say! We live for our freedom, and we are willing to die for our freedom!"   
  
This marks his sharpest departure to date from the policies set forth by Republic Prime Minister Karin Midular. As recently reported, the Krusual Tribal Leader has been lobbying heavily to unseat PM Midular for her failed efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the border disputes. As clashes have sharply increased in their severity and brutality, often backed by Sarum family sympathizers, the public outrage has reached a fever pitch.   
  
Minmatar Prime Minister Karin Midular has called for an emergency Parliamentary meeting, to be held in two days. Details of the agenda are unavailable at this time, but it is expected that the new Amarr Emperor will be the prime subject for their deliberations.
