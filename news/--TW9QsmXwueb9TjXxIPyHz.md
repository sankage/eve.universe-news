# Viewing Halls
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/viewing-halls

All spaceships have a **viewing platform** somewhere in their design. On
larger ships it is a great hall, complete with equipment for viewing
stars. On small [frigates](6FJmBYuBTwDdtiiH8kIHsA), however, it
might only be a small room with a single window and a vidscreen to call
up information on.

One on a ship that carried [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) was in
between, with only a few metal chairs and small backless benches,
decorated with gold religious icons, and a curved wall of [polycarb glass](rtFA3RAt7rP2CNOkQ9Env) that looked out into space.
