As news breaks of a Caldari invasion of Federation territory, mass panic is spreading like wildfire across the nation. Starports are crammed full as citizens attempt to flee from the Caldari advance. Police remain unable to deal with the huge numbers of fleeing citizens and reports are coming in from all over the Federation of casualties caused by the hysteria. 

Citizens looking for support from government officials in the Dodenvale system will be disappointed as witnesses report local government offices are already evacuated. Elsewhere local forces are attempting to urge citizens to remain in their homes with little success.
