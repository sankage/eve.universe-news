**Anteson Ranchel** is the Grand Admiral of the [Gallente Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1). At one point, from a penthouse near the [Crystal Boulevard](45ZcfxzqF7v2mqmLksGxYU), he discussed the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) occupation of [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i) with a captain. When the [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) wild card was brought up, Ranchel wonders where they could put them to keep them away from [Luminaire](1tM3Nx7GG1CbWtq6PcKMwj).
