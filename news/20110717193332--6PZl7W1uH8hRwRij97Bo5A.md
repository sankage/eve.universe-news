A mysterious wormhole has been seen near the first acceleration gate of the Rogue Drone Infestiation Sprout in Hebisa.

Capsuleers from all over New Eden have been attempting to close the wormhole by the use of ECM modules - a tactic proven effective aginst Sansha's Nation last year - for several hours, with little result.  
  
While nothing has yet emerged, capsuleers have been recorded calling for reinforcements in case of an attack.
