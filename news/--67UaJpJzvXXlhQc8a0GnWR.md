**AI**, standing for **Artificial Intelligence**, refers to the
intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to
create it. AI can be broken into two types; weak AI, which can take
information it is programmed to know and make intelligent decisions
based off that but is unable to grow itself, and strong AI, which can
learn and improve itself. In [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk),
weak AI is fairly prevalent, while strong AI is found primarily among
the rogue drones and is highly restricted.

History
-------

Research into artificial intelligence is almost as old as the machine
itself. Records from all civilizations contain stories of tinkerers,
alchemists, and philosophers striving to create a machine that could
think. It was not until the advent of the computer, however, that the
first real artificial intelligence research could commence.

Early breakthroughs typically centered around computers that could
intelligently play complicated games. The first were typically only
challenges to amateurs, but as improvements in computation and
programming techniques emerged, they soon began defeating the top
players. Following this, advances came in creating systems that could
replicate human conversations. This proved to be a much greater
challenge, as teaching a computer ideas such as context, colloquialisms,
and non-literal speech were difficult.

Eventually, however, these issues were overcome, and programs that
seemingly replicated humans perfectly were created. Of course, these
were still weak AIs. They were limited by their programming, only able
to learn new ideas via updates initiated by human hands. Despite this,
these weak AIs were incredibly useful in a variety of fields.

However, the quest for a strong AI continued. A critical turning point
in this research came in YC93, when a joint
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) science
team developed the Orphyx drone. The drone,
built to the size of a battleship and equipped with [warp drive](7o1BhmhKqoA32WfmkW8Yqt), was developed to act independently and
intelligently, primarily for military applications. The AI
malfunctioned, however, and went rogue. The prototype and some related,
lesser drones broke free of their moorings, killed several scientists,
and fled into space. Over the years, these drones captured ships and
used them to jump into other systems, then spread out across the
cluster.

Because of the threat posed by rogue drones,
[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) immediately clamped down on strong AI
research. Despite this, several subsequent illegal programs developed
further strong AI. These, such as the Magnus, Creoptolemus, and more,
all subsequently went rogue and joined the growing plague of rogue
drones. This only reinforced CONCORD's decision to restrict strong
AI research.

Today, most AI research is aimed at improving weak AI. However, strong
AI research continues to occur in secretive facilities across the
cluster. Recent incidents, such as the Spectrum Breach, Code Aria
Inquiry, and contact with the mysterious Sleeper
drones, have renewed interest in strong AIs. One of the many
subdivisions of the Arek'Jaalan program is dedicated to AIs.

Uses
----

### Weak AI

Despite being incapable of independent learning, weak AIs are used in a
large number of fields. They are nearly ubiquitous throughout any
computer system in New Eden, though many are so subtle as to be
unnoticed by the majority of users.

#### Medical

AIs have proved vital in the health care field, as AI doctors took over
many of the diagnostic roles filled by human doctors. These doctors
provide various automated diagnoses, while utilizing modern research
into how best to convey the results of those diagnoses to the patients.
The AI doctors can perform diagnostics on implants as well as run normal
medical tests. They are responsible for deciding if a patient should
have surgery or repairs done and if such operations could be
underwritten.

Similarly, [caretaker drones](rGOC92YOZjJCUlQUhoVdA) were created
to anticipate the needs and prevent injuries. These drones utilize
algorithms to anticipate problems such as falls, heart attacks, and
other health emergencies and either prevent them entirely or provide
immediate attention.

This has brought cheap, relatively inexpensive health care to the vast
majority of people, while freeing humans for more complicated tasks such
as seeking out cures, performing surgeries, and tending to special-needs
patients.

#### Space Industry

Weak AIs have seen the most widespread use in the space ship industry.
Nearly ever [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) ship is equipped with an
AI assistant to keep them informed of things such as the status of their
shields and armor, their autopilot, and docking procedures. These AIs
are skinned with pre-created personalities and voices. The most popular
personality skin is the dry, black humored [Aura](3w2uxlC1v35BdI8sjeVchx),
based off the popular entertainer Excena Foer.

Additionally, AI subsystems take care of a variety of menial tasks on
board ships, such as packing cargo in the most efficient manner. On
board capsuleer ships, these AIs interface with the capsuleer, utilizing
their brainpower and skills to improve their algorithms. This interface
with human brains allows the weak AIs to utilize human creativity and
learning without risking the development of sentience and subsequently
going rogue.

#### Drones

Despite the existence of rogue drones, weak AIs continue to see
extensive use in drones. In combat drones, these weak AIs select
targets, calculate orbital paths and firing arcs, and coordinate their
fire. Though these AIs have proven prone to malfunction, they are rarely
dangerous on the order of the rogue drones, and can quickly be leashed
by direct commands from their controllers. Their AIs can also directly
interface with capsuleers to increase their own abilities.

[Salvage drones](4f8tIhuLBPHJsyPiIW8iwu) utilize AI to maneuver
through wrecks and retrieve valuable components without damaging them
further. Electronic warfare drones use their AIs to modulate their
frequencies and keep counter e-war from completely neutralizing them.

Camera drones use AIs to position
themselves and focus on the correct subjects. Camera utilized in the
entertainment industry are programmed to follow performers and get the
best shots. Security camera drones are capable of following targets
and avoiding destruction, while spy camera drones use similar algorithms
to evade detection.

Already mentioned are caretaker drones, which assist the injured and
infirm. Similar technologies allow for housekeeper and secretary drones,
though these are typically only available to the wealthy, and they
generally prefer human assistants instead. Cleaning bugs, however, are
widespread on stations and ships and utilize weak AI algorithms to set
their cleaning patterns and avoid being stepped on by inattentive
people.

#### Entertainment

AI performers, similar in construction to the Aura AI, have gained
popularity in recent years, particularly in the Federation. AI musicians
create inoffensive songs for mass consumption, with appearances designed
to appeal to specific demographics, particularly teenagers. Virtual
actors and actresses have starred in blockbuster holovids, with a
certain subsection of the populace preferring them to flesh-and-blood
performers.

### Strong AI

The potential uses for strong AIs are many. Strong AIs could perform
their own scientific research, theoretically create works of art
rivaling those made by human minds, solve complex calculations and make
intuitive decisions, come up with military, economic, and social
strategies unfettered by sentiment and emotion, and improve their own
capabilities when the need arises rather than waiting on a programmer to
alter them. However, strong AI has shown a propensity for rebellion, as
even designs that are specifically programmed to be limited in
application have gone rogue.

#### Rogue Drones

The first of the rogue drones was created in YC 93, when the Orphyx
program developed what is thought to be the first strong AI. The
sentience of Orphyx is debatable, but it and subsequent strong AI
programs nearly-universally rebelled against their creators and went
rogue. These earliest drones managed to spread out by capturing
space ships and hiding inside them, utilizing jump gates to travel from
system to system.

The drones behaved very similar to living creatures, constructing homes
for themselves out of wreckage and hollowed out asteroids. They
reproduced by mining materials and attacking space ships, utilizing the
parts to construct new drones. Much like communal insect colonies, once
a hive grew large enough, a new hive mother is created and splits off
with a number of lesser drones to establish a new colony. Even more
worrying, the drones were capable of mutation and innovation, improving
their own designs through both apparent accident and intent.

Within a decade, the drones had spread across settled space and were a
persistent problem to travelers and explorers. They attack ships and
strip mine rich asteroid fields, becoming major threats to both industry
and trade. The drones have also been found to have attacked humans
directly, though their purpose in these assaults appear confused and
have been chalked up to malfunctions by researchers.

Communication with the drones has mostly been impossible. In very rare
cases, some success has been reported, though the drones appear to think
in very simplistic terms. The drones appear to be universally
hostile to humans, with behavioral biologists seeing parallels with the
natural evolution of threat responses in animals.

Late in YC 109, a number of previously offline
[stargates](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) spontaneously reopened, leading to
several regions of sealed off space. These areas had been sealed
following rogue drone attacks years earlier. Once opened, explorers
discovered the regions had been completely colonized by the rogue
drones, apart from human interference. There was some scientific
pressure to leave the drones alone and commence study on their life
cycles, but capsuleers quickly swarmed over the regions and began
forcing the drones out.

#### Sleeper Drones

When the Sleepers were initially discovered beyond the wormholes, their
exact nature of their ships were a mystery. Further study eventually
revealed that they were artificial drones. They appeared to be more
advanced than rogue drones technologically, but also seemed less capable
of independent growth and action.

Theories say that the Sleeper drones are fully developed strong AIs
which remain in thrall to the lost Sleeper race. Because of the danger
of the drones, direct study has been incredibly limited. Most scientists
only have access to their wrecks, delivered by fortune-seeking
capsuleers. However, it is hoped that the Arek'Jaalan will coordinate
efforts and allow further research into the mysterious drones.

Recently, mysterious wormholes have been seen appearing around rogue
drone infestations, drawing concern from [Sansha's Nation](6dFZYDkE3R4BRF9w21mtjP) forces which had been using
wormholes as staging grounds for their invasions. Soon after, a
creature called an "Awakened Informorph" was spotted across New Eden
near rogue drone structures and wormholes. These sightings have
left researchers baffled, with some worrying that the Sleeper Drones and
Rogue Drones have formed some sort of alliance.
