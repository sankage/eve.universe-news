# Year YC109
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/year-yc109

January
-------

January opened with rising tension between the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) and the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
due to a series of attacks in the Empire's [Bleak Lands](1thJ31aFnpCVAbE0rkntPP) region over the preceding months. Put
down to the activities of the Minmatar splinter group know as 'The
[Defiants](6aq75j8f7bMZckaqXWXSC6),' one attack in particular had
successfully destroyed an Amarr battlestation, the first such to be
destroyed since the [Great Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N).
The surprise attack by the Defiants, assisted by rebel capsuleers from
the Ushra'Khan and Fimbulwinter, led Amarr strategists to question the
effectiveness of their security arrangements in the region.

While some chose to
put the blame for this squarely on the shoulders of [Court Chamberlain](4cstqCKrXLAu5XDiqztSe6) [Dochuta Karsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL), interim ruler of the Amarr Empire,
others noted that discipline and the chain of command was in danger of
breaking down after so long without an Emperor. For his part,
Chamberlain Karsoth preferred to concentrate on the role the Minmatar
Republic may have played in the events, with sources from his office
letting it be known that Amarr believed the [Republic Fleet](2c4ZwKPnuW6mYkLJ2dGh94) was supporting the rebels in the Bleak
Lands in contravention of the peace between the two empires. The
Republic Fleet dismissed all such talk as 'ludicrous' and disavowed the
Defiants once more.

As the Bleak Lands became more unstable, the situation in the key
Kor-Azor region of the Amarr Empire seemed as if it might calm down, as
the minor houses of Darabi and Miyan held a peace summit in [Kor-Azor Prime](62Qsy38P0XnR1c2JhWHzFq). The warfare between these minor
houses, who had been fighting over a point of honor concerning the
daughter of [Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) Iraj Darabi (as well as a
territorial dispute), had been of such concern that Amarr
[capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) had involved themselves in the
diplomacy. Unfortunately, whatever hopes the summit may have promised
were dashed as the meeting went on. With the territorial claims over the
Nebian system causing uproar among both sides, Mina Darabi was
confronted by House Miyan's Commander Harkan and fainted. The summit
soon broke up, deadlocked. Hostilities were resumed only two days later
when a Darabi transporter was fired on by Miyan forces, breaking the
ceasefire.

[Maleatu Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV), Speaker of the [Republic Parliament](2EcbNQu5ua4Jjt3TTM0CvW), responded to continuing
complaints from the Amarr Empire over the Defiants and the Bleak Lands
situation with his customary disdain for his old foes. Dismissing the
complaints as an 'over-reaction,' the Brutor parliamentarian also
considered them to be unsurprising given his view of Chamberlain
Karsoth's need to salvage the situation for domestic political purposes.
Indeed, the continual accusations of Republic involvement were
accompanied by substantially increased [Imperial Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g) deployments in the Bleak Lands. Shakor was
clear enough in his denials of Republic help for the Defiants, however,
even if he expressed personal sympathy for his old friend Karishal
Muritor, the group's leader.

February
--------

February saw a surprising development in the story of the Defiants, as
the Republic Fleet moved to once and for all quash the accusations of
its assisting the rebel splinter group. Drawn to the Auga system for a
meeting under flag of truce with Republic Fleet Admiral Kanth Filmir,
Karishal Muritor, leader of the Defiants and former Captain in the
Republic Fleet, was killed after refusing to cease his terrorist
activities and trying to leave the meeting place. Witnessess said the
Minmatar capsuleers accompanying Muritor opened fire on the Republic
Fleet but stood down at the express order of Muritor himself, who
refused to open fire on his old comrades. Muritor's last words are
believed to have been: "Do not forget what we achieved with so few. Do
not forget."

Soon after, the
Minmatar Republic acknowledged responsibility for the death of Karishal
Muritor, confirming that the order to bring the rebel captain in alive
or dead came from the highest level. The shocking news that the Republic
government, and [Prime Minister](11bdx7zZVOpLMWvWjjUg7c) [Karin Midular](3KxlNVAeglPj5ZH0sf3U2j) herself, had authorized the death of
a decorated officer and freedom fighter provoked rallies against the
Midular administration across the Republic. On Gelfiven V, one such
rally descended into violence in the city of Dober Harn. Nine were
killed and dozens arrested, as rioters traded firebombs with police
using anti-riot weaponry. The responsibility for the firebombings was
soon claimed by an organization styling itself "[The Bloody Hands of Matar](1zKTY7AnnG3F5pzlKws52w)," apparently inspired by
the Ushra'Khan, who had called for the resignation of Midular and placed
a 1 ISK bounty on her head.

In the Amarr Empire, while not commenting publicly, the Chamberlain's
office let it be known that Dochuta Karsoth was 'eminently satisfied'
with the outcome. Meanwhile, as the Muritor affair played out, the
warfare between Houses Darabi and Miyan came to an end, with the Miyan
fleet decisively defeated by Darabi forces in the Fensi system. The
surrender of House Miyan resulted in the loss of its control of Nebian
and Fensi, ceded to the Darabi with the consent of the [Royal House Kor-Azor](1S0FEGgzJiwc4yXaG5AzjD).

March
-----

On the first day of March, the [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) issued an unusual statement
confirming attacks on its assets but claiming to have made progress on
the matter, particularly in the capture of two attackers with help from
loyalist capsuleers. For some reason, the Kor-Azor Family saw fit to
comment on the affair and pledge its support. Commentators wondered if
this was linked to increasing criticism of the methods of the Kor-Azor
security forces, widely regarded as extremely brutal even by Amarr
standards, and concerns as to recent proclamations by Royal Heir
[Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV). A decree that had
aroused much comment declared that if any [slaver hound](4nmSv26geCZDYdQ8E5cVh9) was found outside at the same
time as the Heir's own favorite slaver, Gaius, the owner would be
tortured to death and fed to the offending animal.

The situation in the Kor-Azor territories became more serious when the
Holders of the planet Liparer II refused to obey a decree insisting they
wear the soiled and blood-spattered clothes of slaves - a punishment
for some slight that had reached the ears of the unstable Royal Heir.
Aritcio dispatched a fleet to Liparer, declaring the whole planet
treasonous and ordering the heads of the recalcitrant Holders to be
brought before him. With the Holders resisting, and heavy fighting
taking place, the Kor-Azor fleet had made up its mind to bombard the
planet into submission. They were halted only by the surprise
intervention of [Brother Joshua](3GdUiafeRMQKdpzDb8CWnJ) of the Order
of the [Speakers of Truth](3vA8Xh4A10DiybH2UTOEUO) - an order
with some judicial authority in the Amarr Empire under certain
circumstances.

As the month came to a close,
[Amarr Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) [Uriam Kador](7LJKelrqDXAAUYi6o48Uno) spoke out on the matter of the Imperial
Succession, advocating that the Royal Heirs move the process forward if
Court Chamberlain Dochuta Karsoth was unable or unwilling to do so.

April
-----

The Imperial
Succession debate widened in April, with House Sarum Steward [Pomik Haromi](7JF50RSNrYSXLkUmingcwS) and Royal Heir Aritcio Kor-Azor taking
the opportunity to express their views at a meeting of the Amarr [Privy Council](privy-council). While Pomik Haromi insisted on
purity of race in any trial champions, he nevertheless refrained from
indicating whether [House Sarum](4EZ4a3Mw8QXHmisAA4Ff6L) would finally
confirm a new Heir to replace [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L).
Aritcio Kor-Azor's position amounted to insisting that there was only
one logical candidate for the Imperial Throne: himself. Aritcio soon
found himself brought low, however, when Speaker of Truth Brother Joshua
found the Kor-Azor Heir guilty of mass transgressions against the people
of his domain. The Heir was sentenced to a punishment of physical
restitution according to ancient religious law, with him paying the
price for his excesses just short of death itself.

Beyond the Amarr Empire April brought mixed fortunes, with the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) experiencing a child creche scandal and
allegations of secret dealings delaying the sale of technology
corporation Innovaatio Varustukset, while the [Gallente Federation's](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) latest budget report showed a
burgeoning economic upswing. The Minmatar Republic's Karin Midular
admitted that secret talks with the [Ammatar Consulate](LxRVvJ2TIDlhoEWiTfKF2) had been ongoing, to the
outrage of many who saw this as yet more confirmation of the Prime
Minister's 'appeasement' of the Amarr.

As the month ended, the Imperial
Succession debate was further fueled by the interventions of [Houses Ardishapur](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) and
[Tash-Murkon](4t1KEOTA8LvYIHDcOtIPAb). The latter took the view
that any restriction of champions to True Amarr heritage would be
undesirable, an unsurprising position for the
[Udorian](723tMHRDvyldo15RMLMuqh) bloodline house to take. Yonis
Ardishapur, after a conference with Court Chamberlain Karsoth, took the
view that the entire process should be reformed but definitely
controlled by those of [True Amarr](2DkiJVfiL1RYP5y7AJGSNN) blood. With
little sign of agreement between the Heirs, and Aritcio Kor-Azor
indisposed for some time to come, progress on the Succession seemed as
far away as ever.

May
---

The [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) Governor's confirmation that the
Ammatar Consulate had been in talks with the Minmatar Republic, and that
the Amarr Empire had been informed in advance, did nothing to ease
Minmatar anti-government feeling in May. A minor crisis was precipitated
toward the end of the month when the Ammatar representative to the
Republic was killed in a station-bombing in the Egbonbet system. The
Bloody Hands of Matar claimed responsibility for this, demonstrating a
new level of sophistication and greater reach than had been expected of
them.

The Caldari State had to deal with its own troubling popular movement as
the [Brothers of Freedom](1CfzDqtAmLd91V2NPTIB76) organized
protests against corporate excesses. A freighter carrying members and
supporters of the movement to the [Chief Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr) station in New Caldari was
attacked by the paramilitary capsuleers of the Caldari Independent Navy
Reserve, alongside members of the Guardian Shadows organization,
resulting in over 65,000 deaths. In addition to this, the troubled
Caldari technology corporation Innovaatio Varustukset suffered first a
robbery of its main laboratory and then the kidnapping of a scientist by
the [Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) crime organization. Fortunately,
[Nugoeihuvi's](4Ykng1Buej1uH3Sy5ln3jW) [Internal Security](3F5YslD2GfQXvpQPq3EGui) division were later able to
recover the abducted scientist.

June
----

June
brought ruin for Innovaatio Varustukset when the corporation's primary
research station was destroyed by capsuleers acting at the behest of a
renegade Nugoeihuvi employee. More news of capsuleer misdeeds came with
the confirmation by the [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) that the
main responsibility for the New Caldari freighter massacre rested with
the mysterious Guardian Shadows organization and the capsuleers that had
assisted them. The Caldari State was forced to deal with riots breaking
out across its territories, orchestrated by the Brothers of Freedom
movement and suppressed by the Navy and megacorporations security forces
at the cost of thousands of casualties.

July
----

Having been found guilty of tax fraud earlier in the year, in July the
Caldari Gaming Commission pulled out of hosting the capsuleer Alliance
Tournaments. The popular event was saved when the newly-formed
Independent Gaming Commission stepped into the breach, promising a
bigger and better tournament than ever before.

August
------

The Caldari
State finally restored a semblance of order, suppressing the Brothers of
Freedom protests and riots. By August they even claimed to have killed
the only two capsuleers to profess membership in the outlawed movement.
Simultaneous strikes against the ships and [cloning](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o)
bays of the two capsuleers ensured they would not be returning from the
dead.

August was also notable for the capture by Gallente [Federation Customs](2LZwH7MsRSRhlMHNegrgGx) of a [Serpentis](3igWGHqQJXyJoUnM2XgGJC) Corporation carrier laden with the
designer drug Rise. Several members of the [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn)
Illoren movement were later arrested by Federation authorities when they
protested the handling of the carrier capture, among them Vorada
Kuvakei, former [Mordu's Legion](5csCeDqUe1exvVyfPdL75Q) officer and
leader of the Illoren.

September
---------

Vorada Kuvakei and his associates were
not long in gaining their freedom, for in September a plea bargain saw
them released by the Federation, to much comment and speculation.
Overshadowing all news this month, however, was the 4th Alliance
Tournament, an event most spectators agreed was the most thrilling of
the series yet. Highlights included the then-unprecedented defeat of the
Band of Brothers alliance by the Star Fraction's ten-man Thorax charge
and, of course, the final itself, where the championship was taken by
worthy winners HUN Reloaded after a hard-fought battle against
runners-up Pandemic Legion.

[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) may have considered its business in YC109
to be routine so far, and it was able to announce a naming committee for
the so-called "Drone Regions" before October began. Unfortunately for
the peace-keeping organization, it was to be the subject of rumor and
outrage before the month was over. The resignation of CONCORD Commander
Gispali Rhatal started whispers when his service record was discovered
to contain numerous inconsistencies. This was followed by the hijacking
of a CONCORD prison transport in the Eurgrana system by unknown but
undoubtedly daring terrorists. CONCORD authorities ensured the
destruction of the transport and its hijackers by placing an emergency
bounty on the ship, which capsuleers rushed to collect when the ship
undocked.

November
--------

November started with the discovery by [Poteque Pharmaceuticals](5pclxHc3Y9LqxvXcSANy4O) scientists of
potentially harvestable gas clouds in low-security Gallente space. The
gas clouds were to be a theme of the month, with scientists and
corporations in other empires discovering similar cloud formations using
Poteque's techniques. Associated with booster production, gas clouds
harvestable for complex chemicals were always a controversial issue.
However, the nascent furor over the discoveries was damped down by
analyses showing that little or no high-value resources could be derived
from them.

CONCORD tried to take the heat out of conspiracy theories about former
Commander Gispali Rhatal by classifying inconsistencies as filing errors
and showing that the CONCORD officer had been a logistics coordinator
during the period missing from his record. The affair retained a life of
its own through the month, however, with the Gallente Federation
involving itself in the case of missing CONCORD Captain Bethol Kozer,
whose partner Mera Vahlsina believed Rhatal had relevant information.
Eventually, CONCORD's Inner Circle responded to the Federation,
indicating they would look into the matter.

In the meantime, the Amarr Empire's [Ministry of Assessment](79mGvIq3LHSJ3KiUPcd46v) took the step of
declaring the Bleak Lands region to be the most dangerous sector of
settled space within the Empire. The Ministry attributed the Bleaks'
falling below Aridia in safety terms to a significant rise in
pirateattacks and the activities of remaining pockets of [Blood Raider](7obiU8rOyJkPZ3S0Faxc5W) loyalists. With local Holders
expressing their own concerns, Court Chamberlain Dochuta Karsoth
declined to comment on the matter. Even when an entire colony of
Minmatar slaves vanished after an attack by an unidentified force, the
Amarr Empire's administration remained silent, despite pressure from the
Holders.

December
--------

December saw the arrival in the troubled
Bleak Lands of the Amarr [7th Fleet](7xcqb3UtNf8RQP1f4jJ6cp) under the
command of Admiral [Vanazir Saracen](5yh6X5XInEkD9aWQnXPF5X). Losing
no time in trying to establish order in the region, the 7th Fleet began
a program of fortifications and initiated regular patrols. Local Holders
were broadly welcoming of this development, though some complained about
the Imperial tithe instituted by Admiral Saracen.

A variety of new technologies emerged in the last few weeks of the year,
with new possibilities bestowed upon the independent pilot through
developments in advanced weapons points, drone control systems and a
remarkable new technique for generating a warp disruption field around
ships' hulls. Even the low-security gas clouds that had been dismissed
as worthless were found to hold potential for a new form of "synthetic
booster" production. CONCORD was happy to license the new technologies
on its usual basis of sharing across all empires and also announced its
official nomenclature for the "Drone Regions," the eight regions
exchanging their previous alpha-numeric designations for proper names.

Despite the arrival of the 7th Fleet in the Bleak Lands, the year YC109
was to end with conflict in the region flaring up anew. As the Amarr
forces pressed ahead with their fortification program, they confidently
took their communications relays offline in order to upgrade them.
Within minutes the Minmatar Defiants launched multiple surprise attacks
on the 7th Fleet. Independent media networks broadcast a chilling
message: "You thought we were gone. You were wrong."

It seemed that despite the death of their leader, Karishal Muritor, the
rebel group was still a force to be reckoned with. They showed this
throughout the remainder of the year as strike after strike was launched
on the 7th Fleet and other Amarr facilities. The culmination of this
campaign was the destruction of the Imperial Navy's central defense
cortex in the Bleak Lands, leaving the 7th Fleet struggling without
command and control. As the year drew to a close it seemed in no doubt
that the estimations of Defiant capabilities by Amarr commanders had
been woefully inadequate.
