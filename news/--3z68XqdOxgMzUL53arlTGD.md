**Shan Arvonak** is a [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) and an
[Angel](3p6aB4GMbVdMUEVYOb3kF0) raider. He is a smoker and thinks very
little about putting his cigarette butts out on the hangar deck. He
keeps an [Adakul](1QKGVCG3SPqc6sCRnnw9Vp) text hidden in his footlocker which
describes meditation techniques he finds useful for staying calm during
fleet operations.
