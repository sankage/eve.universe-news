[Last year](http://at.eve-ic.net/8/index.php?view=article&id=2), teams threw everything they had into a bid to win the Mimir and Freki Minmatar-based modified assault ships. Among the ships fielded, we saw extensive use of Marauders, Black Ops, Strategic Cruisers, and Faction ships.  
  
Pandemic Legion managed to come out on top in last year's tournament. Will they once again manage to capture the top spot? Come join us at our website and find out.
