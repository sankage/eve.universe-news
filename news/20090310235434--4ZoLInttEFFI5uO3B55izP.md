Only moments after seizing a CreoDron facility somewhere in the Barille constellation, Federation Navy officials have reported to local media that contact with the CreoDron team cannot be established. The Navy is claiming to have only just recently located the site of the wormhole, which they believe Prof. Burreau and her team have entered, aiming to explore the other side.

"Immediately upon securing the facility, we set about establishing a priority commlink with Professor Burreau," stated one military official. "We have not yet been able to make contact with her team, nor the drones that initially entered the system. For now, the best we can do is wait and hope."
