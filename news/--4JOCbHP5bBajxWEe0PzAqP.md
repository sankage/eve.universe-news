# Null Crown
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/null-crown

A **null crown** is a brace worn around the head which incapacitates
motor skills and physical movement below the neck by using
neurologically-tuned, modulated electromagnetic pulses. Victims in this
"null state" are aware of their surroundings but are paralyzed. Movement
and sensation return after the device is removed, but permanent damage
is possible if left in this state for extended periods of time.
