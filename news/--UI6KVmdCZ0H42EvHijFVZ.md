# Dam-Torsad
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/dam-torsad

**Dam-Torsad** is the Imperial City of the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo).
Which is located in the northern hemisphere on
[Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4), situated on
[Amarr Island](4wZzhhUMIfR4ziHGaMOiLJ), and made up of several
districts, like for example
[Torsad-Laur](2w4NAgugzCIUNDLfeIk0C8). It has walls that have been
described as "oppressive" by [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) ambassador
[Yanou Lautere](5IsiBXSZHsr1GKxBJXsO61). The core of the city is generally
considered more similar to a monument to past glories than a modern
metropolis. The [Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) and Privy
Council continue to rule and hold full
meetings from the city, though in the age of space travel, it is as
often as not that the Emperor will not even be present.

One thing that is true of almost all people on Dam-Torsad is that they
share a great general tendency to stay in direct active communion with
one another while in public, chanting, praying, or speaking loudly and
at great length. The environment of Dam-Torsad encourages this behavior
in both subtle and unsubtle ways, through pray-drones, billboards, and
other disruptive phenomena designed to habitually reinforce preference
for communion.
