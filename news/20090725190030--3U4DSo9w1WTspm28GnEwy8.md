Ishukone has announced that it will be selling transcranial microcontrollers to interested Holders at "bulk rates".  
  
"Ishukone is opening its arms to the Empire with this unprecedented offer," read the press release from the megacorp. "With the recent debate in the Empire, knowledge and acceptance of Transcranial Microcontrollers will only grow. By offering to keep prices low and affordable, many holders may now benefit from their numerous applications as a method of workforce control."  
  
The press release urges interested holders to "contact their nearest Ishukone representative for pricing and order size details." It is unknown how many holders will take up the offer, though Ishukone predicts the numbers will be "significant."  
  
Some have claimed that the offer is meaningless, pointing to the declining popularity of the Caldari-made devices in a hostile Gallente Federation, the reduced production cost of technology several years old, as well as the availability of a number of similar devices on the market. "Essentially, Ishukone is offering to cut out the 'brand name' price markup for holders," stated one analyst.
