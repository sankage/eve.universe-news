# Nano Disintegration
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/nano-disintegration

**Nano disintegration** is a method of execution.

The ugly physical part
----------------------

The subject is injected or sprayed with a solution containing millions
of nanobots ([Nanolysins](mhWtQV8PVale7utCMOBgB)) which have been
programmed to break down any organic matter they come into contact with.
What follows is a particularly painful and unpleasant death as the
victim is effectively melted down on the spot over a period of two to
three minutes.

Assassination use
-----------------

Nano disintegration is sometimes used as an assassination tool, as the
only remains of the victim are a puddle of foul-smelling fluid, their
clothing and any implants they had. All of which can be quickly and
easily disposed of, leaving very little evidence that the assassination
has taken place.

Gallente-Caldari war catalyst
-----------------------------

The most famous person to be killed in this way was Admiral [Alexander Noir](7yGm9JcjjD577R4fjG6D4t), who was murdered in his own home by
[the Broker](35XiT6V98vAeV9AdpZyl72) as part of a plot to spark a second
war between the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and the
[Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) by crashing the FNS Wandering Saint
into the [Ishukone](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) Headquarters in the Malkalen system.
