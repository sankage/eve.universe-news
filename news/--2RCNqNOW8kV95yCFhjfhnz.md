# Ammatar
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/ammatar

The **Ammatar** were originally known as the
[Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2) Tribe, one of the seven tribes of the
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp). During the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
occupation - when the Empire invaded the Minmatar homeworlds - the
Nefantar collaborated extensively with Imperial agents.

Creation of the Ammatar Mandate
-------------------------------

In the aftermath of the [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N),
when the Minmatar cast out
the collaborators along with the Amarr, the Nefantar were granted the
region of Derelik to settle as a protectorate of the Empire.. They
gained their name of Ammatar from the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK),
who used it to distinguish them from the Minmatar aristocracy who
remained in the Republic.

Organization and Amarr ties
---------------------------

Their domain, San-Matar, is semi-autonomous. They have patterned their
government and society off that of the Empire, and have several direct
ties direct to the Amarr. Formost of these are the fact that the Ammatar
are governed by an Amarr governor who rules over numerous Ammatar heads
of state, and that the Ammatar Navy is under the command of the Amarr
Empire.

Minmatar stance
---------------

The Ammatar have been in a constant state of warfare with the Minmatar
Republic since their inception, especially as both sides have expanded
considerably over the past decades. The Republic historically had the
upper hand, but in recent years the Ammatar have begun an aggressive
campaign. It's been rumored they were given assistance by the
[Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) in exchange for mineral rights

Recent Events
-------------

The Mandate has been struggling with the biggest crisis in its entire
history. The direct effects of the Elder |invasion and the wholesale
destruction of large parts of the Home Fleet, big news in any other
circumstances, have been largely ignored due to the more pressing issue
that cuts to the very heart of the Ammatar identity - namely the
revelation that the original defection was blessed by the Minmatar
Elders so that the Nefantar could protect the remnants of the
[Starkmanir tribe](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw).

While former governor [Ana Utulf's](7wtM3XjsKYiuGDdDJW14Vh) urging to
Ammatar citizens to defect to the Republic did elicit some positive
response, mostly among the persecuted minority who still cling to their
Minmatar roots, the majority of the Mandate viewed her actions as a
heinous betrayal of the Mandate's principles. Traditional education in
the region has always focused on teaching the value of the Amarr way of
life and the Ammatars' privileged place at their side, and the news that
their beliefs about the noble origins of the Mandate may be entirely
false have been a crushing blow to the morale of many citizens.

However, [Yonis Ardishapur's](4Tb1Uk75SycuFuiizODkZD) rule over the
Mandate has restored faith among many Ammatar.
