DED is gravely concerned over recent reports describing drastic reorganization for many pirate factions in the outer regions. The scale and scope of the changes have led many to belief that a hidden party is responsible for them and DED is now launching an all out investigation to identify the culprits and urges anyone with any information bearing on the matter to come forward.   
  
The command structure of many of the most infamous pirate factions, such as the Guristas and Sanshaâ€™s Nation, has been radically altered and now has more in common with regular empire navies. A command hierarchy has been put into place, with added responsibility and communications. Pirates are already a considerable nuisance for space travelers outside empire space and pilots are cautioned that the pirates will likely make their presence felt even more strongly now.
