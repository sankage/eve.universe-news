Ardishapur Prime - Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur has personally ordered a massive injection of funds to be made available to the 24th Imperial Crusade for the purposes of reconstruction in the war-torn Ezzara system. Ezzara has been the scene of bitter fighting between the 24th Imperial Crusade and the Tribal Liberation Force since the beginning of the conflict in YC110. The system has changed hands several times and its infrastructure is significantly degraded.

In addition to the funds, the Ammatar Fleet has confirmed that at the order of the Heir, the 1st Mandate Redemptionist Brigade is to take up duties assisting in the reconstruction of vital infrastructure in Ezzara. Primarily a logistical and engineering brigade, the 1st Redemptionist is composed of three regiments of penal troopers drawn from the ranks of dishonored Ammatar Mandate forces and civilians convicted of aid or sympathy for defectors.
