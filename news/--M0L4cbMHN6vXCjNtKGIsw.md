# Braggs Seyllin
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/braggs-seyllin

Braggs Seyllin was an executive at [Material Acquisition](uU1699OxOEmlDBcMm0qZA) who left to prospect on his own. After many years of hardship, he struck gold in system TLXX-01 which was later named [Seyllin](1SX3stmn3UJS4nAXLNeUsG) in his honor. It was his insistence on human labor over drones that is almost single-handedly responsible for the growth of [Seyllin I](rcmhOIWig0zQ49j4fNF7m), with three of the four main cities there being established in his life time.
