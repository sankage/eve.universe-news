Luminaire - *** This is a breaking news story *** The Gallente Federation capital system of Luminaire has been locked down from the inside by the Caldari Navy and an accompanying task force composed of thousands of ships. Witnesses describe sighting capital ships representing every mega-corporation and at least one Leviathan titan in the armada that smashed its way into the system. As hundreds of Federation Navy warships amassed outside the Luminaire stargates in Algogille and Pettinck, numerous distress calls could be heard on subspace comm channels monitored by Scope News. 

Unconfirmed reports have surfaced that anti-ship mines have been deployed at all stargate entry points inside Luminaire, and that any attempt to run the blockade, no matter how many ships are sacrificed, is effectively impossible.
