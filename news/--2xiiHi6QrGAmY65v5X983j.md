# Hangars
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/hangars

**Hangars**, or starship docking facilities, are present on all space stations.

Access
------

Hangar ingress/egress can be reached in station via lifts. Access to these areas is controlled through various means, including use of
IDImplants and [datapads](6Ih40G42NoYPKinOtdIQQ3). A security code is required at the end of the corridor immediately preceding entry to the
hangar itself, entered on a keypad next to the door.

Architecture and setup
----------------------

The hangar space containing the suspended ship is cylindrical in shape
and pressurized. [Capsules](Capsule-lore) can be stored
outside the docked ship at a landing at the base of a set of stairs.
Hangars also contain panels which provide hangar and capsule control to
authorized users and allow access to local corporation information.
Among other tasks, corporation members are able to use these panels to
transfer ISK between accounts, including to or from the corporation's
wallet.

Working conditions
------------------

Typically, many station workers are employed in the docks and it is
considered harsh labor.
