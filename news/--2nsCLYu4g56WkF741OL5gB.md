# Sokavali Solution
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/sokavali-solution

**Sokavali Solution** is a corrosive preparation originally designed for
skinning human corpses that were to be used for medical purposes.

Historical Background
---------------------

This greenish acid was first developed to dissolve human skin by
creating an electron transfer event in the molecules of ectodermal
tissue. Discovered by [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) scientists before
the seceded from the [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK), it was intended
to be used to remove the skin of medical corpses, leaving the muscle
structure and all other organs intact and exposed.

Recently, it has come to more prominent uses in the food industry, where
it is used to skin livestock whose skin serves no other purpose, such as
[blackfowl](3UkdFgZAbL4xiqRSCwthdg).

While the correct term is Sokavali Solution, the use of it in a joke in
the comedic holoreel "The Holovid Repairman" has led to it being
colloquially referred to as 'the green acid.'
