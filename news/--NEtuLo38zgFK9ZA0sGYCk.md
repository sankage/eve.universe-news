# Mountain Wind
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/mountain-wind

**Mountain Wind** is one of the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) spirits.

Mountain Wind is the watcher of the skies and of the lands, swirling
about the high peaks of world, carrying news of what he finds to the
other spirits. Though a silent observer, when he speaks the other
spirits listen, and Caldari would do best to listen as well; he does not
waste words on trivialities. One Caldari folktale from the time just
after contact with the Gallente describes him giving the first words of
warning about the new visitors- "they come to tame the wind." Mountain
Wind is also portrayed as the patron of scholars and historians, and has
particular importance for the [Kaalakiota Corporation](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK), which is named for the towering mountains where the Caldari believe he is strongest.

Other divine entities include
[Wind-of-the-West](3FsbhfAVn48VZcWAXiTReI), [Cold Wind](16iSgSK58hOq8DIlx2oqKS), [Heart-of-the-Forest](3zH6qMixgVJtQUgHF3KFFM), and [Storm Wind](vAU7b4dGGPGQNp6QRw6mX).
