**PR-8CA, Delve** \- The last two weeks have seen the region of Delve plunged into all-out warfare. Sovereignty-holders KenZoku are currently losing sovereignty in several systems, while those systems where their claim has held have now secured Protectorate sovereignty.

### The War so Far  


The war began when the CONCORD-registered Band of Brothers alliance was [disbanded by a director, Arkannen](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?article=2749), who defected to the alliance's enemy, GoonSwarm.

The member corporations of Band of Brothers [reformed in KenZoku](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.eveonline.com%2Fwiki%2FKenZoku_\(Player_alliance\)), previously an industrial alliance for Reikoku-affilliated corporations. Their previous Province and Capital sovereignties in the region were lost, but KenZoku was able to make a [territorial sovereignty claim](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Falliance%2FKenZoku%2Fchanges) to systems formerly claimed under the Band of Brothers identity.

KenZoku's old enemies - GoonSwarm, Pandemic Legion and the Northern Coalition's RAZOR Alliance and Morsus Mihi - launched a full-scale invasion of the region, intending to conquer it before full sovereignty over the area could be restored.

The forces allied against KenZoku have attempted to [confine most of the defender's forces](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dr3B12GCT4JY%26e) into a Blood Raider Covenant station in PR-8CA and maintain a continual heavy guard in the system, while the rest of the attacking forces focus on [removing the defending alliance's control towers](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdl.eve-files.com%2Fmedia%2Fcorp%2Fverite%2F20090221.png).

Meanwhile, KenZoku's allies Against ALL Authorities are [attacking the former home territories](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Falliance%2FGoonSwarm%2Fchanges) of GoonSwarm alongside C0ven and Stain Empire. GoonSwarm state that they have [abandoned these systems](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Falliance%2FGoonSwarm%2Fchanges) for the time being and, it is claimed, will [reconquer them](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eveonline.com%2Fingameboard.asp%3Fa%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D1001331%26page%3D2%2342) once Delve has fallen.

To date, KenZoku has lost its [sovereignty claims](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Falliance%2FKenZoku%2Fchanges) in 44 systems, though it then reclaimed two, while sufficient towers have survived to [claim Protectorate sovereignty](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Falliance%2FKenZoku%2Fchanges) in some 70 systems in Catch, Delve, Querious, Detorid and Period Basis.

### Dining in NOL  


In particular, the outpost in NOL-M9 has assumed a symbolic importance in the conflict. It is widely rumoured that Goonswarm once vowed to dine in NOL-M9, the site of Band of Brother's outpost, The Alamo. (Ownership of the outpost passed to KenZoku and is currently with Pandemic Legion, who renamed it "[The Lmao](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Fsystem%2FNOL-M9).")

XxAngelxX is CEO of The Illuminati, a Pandemic Legion corporation spoke about the conquest:

"We took it the first day that [sovereignty] dropped, then [KenZoku] retook it but we expect to have it back in about a week. We've had more important things to do than NOL-M9 recently.

"Pandemic Legion itself has / is in the process of taking FinFleet's sovereignty 4 constellation. We took the first station today in 5-6QW7. As for other sovereignty 4 constellations, I believe [GoonSwarm] and [the Northern Coalition] are well on their way with those too."

Since this interview, Pandemic Legion has [completed both these objectives](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fevemaps.dotlan.net%2Fregion%2FDelve), holding both NOL-M9 and the 1-A81R constellation. XxAngelxX continued:

"There really has been little resistance. One of the major parts of this has been the 23/7 perma camp in PR-8CA which was well known to be [KenZoku's]... staging [area] and where they told GBC to regroup to, too.

"With their assets and ships locked in station, titans [caged] in their POS and massive issues with security, we haven't really seen much fight from them in the last couple of days. We've destroyed [approximately] 50 large POS in station systems in the last 2 days without resistance.

"At the moment, it's hardly a war. We'll see if [KenZoku] actually have a strategic plan after [Against ALL Authorities] finish with [the] old [GoonSwarm] space, but right now we are taking this space like no-one ever lived in it....the only battles we have had are ganking Shrike, ganking Waagaa's aeon and ganking an [Axiom Empire] aeon last night."

### "At Our Own Will"

LadyScarlet is an officer in Destructive Influence, a KenZoku corporation. She gave her perspective on the efforts to blockade KenZoku forces inside PR-8CA:

"If you mean are we locked [in], no. We still move at our own will. Of course, it all depends on whom you ask - everyone has an opinion on the matter. I like to think we are playing [this] our way, not by GoonSwarm's dictations.

"Sure, there will be [sovereignty] flips, but as history has shown, the last time they came here, we took it all back. [It's just] a matter of time.

"They don't have enough people to accomplish their goal."
