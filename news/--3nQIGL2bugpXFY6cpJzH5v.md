# Nano-Tattoos
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/nano-tattoos

**Nano-tattoos** are a form of tattooing that employ microscopic
microchips embedded in the skin. When activated, the chips cause color
changes that create patterns on the skin. The practice originated with
the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp), but has spread to the other races,
becoming particularly popular among [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
youth.

Brief History of Tattooing
--------------------------

The practice of tattooing is an ancient art among the Minmatar. It
evolved from the tribal custom of using war paint and came to
dominate many aspects of Minmatar culture. Though it was suppressed by
the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) during their conquest and enslavement of
the Minmatar, tattooing was preserved in secret and openly revived
following the [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N). Over
years, it has returned to being a high art among the Minmatar, with
adults having many intricate tattoos, some covering their entire
bodies.

A popular form of tattooing involves mimicking the patterns of war paint
on the face. The downside of this was the constant aggressive posture it
caused the wearer to hold. This frequently caused issues with
communication and diplomacy, particularly between tribes and with the
other races. Given the options of either discontinuing the practice, or
living with the consequences, Minmatar tattoo artists and scientists
sought a third solution.

Former Technologies
-------------------

Many different solutions were attempted and ultimately discarded. The
first real success came with heat-sensitive dyes. These dyes were nearly
skin-tone colored when at regular body temperatures, but would darken
when heated. The theory was that when a wearer became agitated, angry,
or otherwise emotionally excited, the tattoos would become visible.

While it worked as intended, the tattoos would also appear at
inopportune times as well, such as during moments of extreme joy,
lovemaking, intensive work, on hot days, and even during embarrassment.
Additionally, the dyes were limited to a few skin tones, such that many
[Brutor](5xBrtZyeYfTxWkZTO1o5zg) and
[Vherokior](6VDPzsKX9TVbVtXEwjj0RB) tribesmen were unable to use them.

A later attempt came with subdermal LEDs. The LEDs were initially tuned
to the user's emotions, so that they only appeared during proper
moments. Gone were the stories of children hugging their tattooed
parents, only to run screaming in terror when the color changing dyes
activated in response to the parent's rising body temperature from joy.

However, the LEDs were widely considered garish and ugly. The tattoos
did not resemble tattoos as much as bioluminescence, giving users the
perjorative nickname "fireflies". While the LEDs remain somewhat in use
by body-modders and among elements of the Gallente club culture, they
quickly fell out of use among the Minmatar. However, many of the
technologies used came to be vital in the eventual solution.

Technology
----------

While LEDs proved unpopular, LCD technology eventually was adapted to
become a solution. First coming onto the market in YC101, these LCDs
were attached to microscopic integrated circuits that were implanted in
the skin. Unlike with the LEDs, the LCDs needed to be more shallow to be
visible, and were thus placed between the epidermal and dermal layers of
skin.

The microchips are attached to nerve clusters in the sweat glands and
hair follicles. This allows the chips to read the user's emotional
state, through a combination of biological signals such as the pilomotor
reflex and adrenaline levels. When the chips detect anger, fear, or
excitement, the LCDs activate and either darken or lighten, depending on
the wearer's skin tone, creating extensive patterns across the skin.

Recent developments have allowed more control over the tattoos as well
as variations in the color patterns. Newer chips can be tied directly to
the user's nervous system, allowing the user to turn the tattoos on and
off at a whim, rather than being tied to emotions. Additionally, some
have colors that can be altered either according to the user's emotional
state, producing, for instance, red tattoos when angry and blue ones
when excited, or consciously controlled so that the tattoo can be any
variety of colors the wearer wishes.

Many more traditional Minmatar look down on those who have controllable
tattoos, as they believe it indicates a lack of discipline. Gallente
youth have appropriated the tattoos as a fashion statement, along with
other pieces of Minmatar culture, which has led to tension, particularly
in ethnic Minmatar communities in the Federation. Among the
Gallente, the controllable tattoos are the norm, allowing the wearers to
be "rebellious" when out of the eyes of authority figures whose
disapproval might cause problems.
