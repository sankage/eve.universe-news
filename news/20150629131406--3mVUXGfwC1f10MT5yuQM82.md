Rapid Withdrawal specialises in faction warfare, currently based out of the 0.3 system Sujarento in the Citadel. They are currently "fighting for the glory of the Gallente." 

Rapid Withdrawal participates in a number of activities ranging from DED sites, level 5 missions and gate camping, all the way up to 20+man cruiser fleets. It's common to find members running in groups of 4 or more pilots in small gang warfare, fighting in complexes.

To hold their space with pride is their driving focus and they certainly won't give it up without a fight, with a philosophy of "Come on over and get some" to those that would oppose them.

With a need for more capsuleers on the Gallente faction warfare frontlines, Rapid Withdrawal is always recruiting and will take any capsuleer eager to fight in factional warfare in aid of the Gallente.

With a small batch of excellent Fleet Commanders, and an active philosophy to push able pilots into "leadership" type roles in industry or Fleet Command, growth in a capsuleers career and knowledge base when joining Rapid Withdrawal is almost assured.
