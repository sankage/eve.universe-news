# Roten
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/roten

**Roten** is a former apprentice of the old man. Ages back, he left the
space colony he was working on to serve on board a freighter.

He suddenly appeared to the old man one day, though he appears
see-through because of the odd problems with the man's vision. They two
shared a short conversation before Roten departed, promising to see him
again soon.
