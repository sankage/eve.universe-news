# Keral
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/keral

**Keral** is the cloned son of [Bethora](5wsvjWAtEn3fgbxYCq7eG3). He is a
member of the [Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) and thus
a part of [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) [royalty](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh).

Parental pressure
-----------------

His unnamed father constantly pressured Keral to succeed in his studies,
though Keral did not show much talent for them and constantly fell
behind. After his father died, Bethora took up the task of pushing him
to achieve bigger and better things.

The race
--------

At her behest, he participated in a [spaceship race](2ryywB98oyDuraCpSPpxqE) where the goal was to destroy and
retrieve beacons in an asteroid field. His second was
Selan, the son of Raana.

The race was meant to test leadership skills, and was thus done in a
standard frigate rather than a pod-piloted
ship. Perhaps at Bethora's insistence, Keral fitted his ship with
prototype rigs which were illegal and
untested. The ship did well in the race, but as it neared the finish
several systems malfunctioned, causing it to fly out of control and
crash into a beacon. The crash killed Selan and fatally wounded Keral.

Illegal cloning
---------------

Bethora, unwilling to lose her son, ordered the doctors to clone Keral
despite the [Scriptural](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp) doctrine of [Sacred Flesh](3k3re1JeaMxvvTRz3qARFv) forbidding royals Amarr flesh from being
cloned. The [cloning](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o) went awry because of the lack
of proper procedures, leaving Keral with extreme brain damage. He was
reduced to shouting out phrases from movies, tossing things around,
spinning in place, and shutting the lights on and off at random.
