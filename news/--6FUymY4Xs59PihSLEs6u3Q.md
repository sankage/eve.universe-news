# The Electric Museum
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-electric-museum

**The Electric Museum** is a station-based institution funded by the
[Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) megacorps that displays previous
technological advancements by the Caldari, focusing primarily on ship
modules. The museum is free to enter, though it has some ticketed
special sections.

The main area of the museum has modules protected under glass with
[holoprojectors](3R2yaSdkUb08ifof3FfTZd) that give text information
on the modules. The museum has an option for the blind that allows them
to touch the module as the information is read out to them.

A special section of the museum has modules that are sitting unprotected
on pedestals, though they are not supposed to be touched by visitors.
These modules are all from [Kaalakiota Corporation](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK) and [Sukuuvestaa Corporation](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB) and are the result of
a forbidden affair between [David](3H01yyv6huJ5QjGhvOP55j), the former CEO of
KK, and [Yonate](6EWutHvfhZLE0KAKiJdTNM), the former CFO of SuVee.

[Entrye Chrare](2M6na4iZkeZ4GqtRcpR2xK) is an aged curator of the
museum who gives guided tours. [Ruebin](46Sf8a6drmXcf4cWZGYlTw) visited once
and joined up with one of Entrye's tours, staying after for a private
discussion of the exhibits.
