## BREAKING - Caldari Navy Seizes Control of Athounon Strategic Sites

Athounon, Placid â€“ Caldari Navy fleets are reported to have arrived in force in Athounon system, seizing control of strategic sites such as the derelict EDENCOM station, Gallente stargate construction site, and reinforcing the State's military presence throughout the system. Reports indicate the Caldari Navy has stopped short of seizing complete control and capturing the system's militia infrastructure hub, under a plan authorized by the Caldari Chief Executive Panel.

Caldari forces are also reported to have arrived in such numbers so as to thoroughly sweep Athounon and the surrounding Serthoulde constellation clear of unsecured Triglavian relay sites. The swift deployment of Caldari fleet forces has foreclosed the possibility of the Gallente Federation completing its stargate, while bringing to a decisive close any further efforts to secure data on the Triglavian technology present in Athounon and surrounding systems.

The move appears to be a limited response to the Federation invasion of Intaki, treading a line that remains for the moment within the terms of the CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act. CEP Chairman Akimaka Saraki has described the Federation Navy's massive invasion of Intaki and two constellations formerly in the Placid warzone as "outrageous", however the Caldari State's CEP appears to be following a cautious line aimed at projecting itself as the lawful party seeking to avoid escalation to full-scale war.

Following yesterday's emergency meeting of the Chief Executive Panel, the CEOs of the Hyasyoda, Kaalakiota, and Nugoeihuvi megacorporations have all travelled to Yulai to represent the Caldari at the CONCORD Assembly in a united front of the corporate factions that dominate the State. CONCORD Inner Circle President Seri Okonaya has issued an executive communique deploring the "unilateral and grave breach of the CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act" by the Gallente Federation.
