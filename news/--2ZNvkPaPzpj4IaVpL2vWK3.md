# Idonis Ardishapur
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/idonis-ardishapur

Once Heir of the Ardishapur Family, **Idonis Ardishapur** was considered
a religious fanatic. He was extremely conservative and xenophobic and
valued traditions over everything else. He was not overtly militaristic,
but rather more of an isolationist.

Idonis was the son of [Arkon Ardishapur](17tWRlpXtkWqoUBdAdWGxN)
and had moved with him to Ezzara VI to bring the
[Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp) to the
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp). While he and his friend Zoriac had
belittled the Minmatar back home, they came to have an appreciation for
their culture. Idonis even began a clandestine affair with a Starkmanir
woman.

When his father Arkon was murdered by [Drupar Maak](4jYB1gA3QgB54Pi5vxP3Em) during a slave revolt, Idonis's first act
to was to avenge this death with the destruction of all the
[Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) on Arzad II, bombarding them from
orbit.

He later issued the edict Khaderia's Law, shortly after the discovery of
Starkman Prime, or Arzad II. The edict, not widely publicized or even
understood by Imperial lawyers-yet tacitly enforced nonetheless-states
unconditionally that no further harm shall directly befall Arzad II.

Idonis committed suicide at the end of the [Amarr Succession](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx) which saw [Doriam Kor-Azor](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT) rise to the throne.
