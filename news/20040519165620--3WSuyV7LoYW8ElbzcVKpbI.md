According to spokesmen from the Secure Commerce Commission, an emergency moratorium has been placed on the four empires’ upcoming initiative to buy back Misu Baniya’s body parts on the market.   
  
The moratorium, SCC officials say, is due to the “massive effect these transactions will have on the galactic economy. We are talking about a multi-billion ISK influx here, and these prices will need to be regulated and monitored carefully if we are not to fall head-first into an inflation the likes of which hasn’t been seen in hundreds of years. These kinds of large-scale market ventures need to be handled with the utmost care.”   
  
The SCC has set next Friday as a tentative date for the moratorium’s lifting, at which point new details regarding the market initiative will be brought to light.
