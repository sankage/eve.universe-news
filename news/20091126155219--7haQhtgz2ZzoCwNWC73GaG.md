Arvasaras - A series of detonations reverberated throughout the Sukuuvestaa Corporation Production Plant in the Arvasaras system , resulting in several parts of the station being without power and life support services for hours. The explosions were centered on a Peace and Order Unit precinct in the station, as well as several key facilities such as power management relays.

News crews from the Nugoeihuvi Corporation have reported injured people being saved from the affected areas, but there have been no confirmation from  Sukuuvestaa regarding the number of casualties.

Sources within the Peace and Order Unit say that an investigation into the attack is already underway, and that details may be released should it be deemed necessary.
