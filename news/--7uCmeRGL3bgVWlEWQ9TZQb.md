# Shathol'Syn
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/shatholsyn

Shathol'Syn is the ritual suicide committed by the four losing
[Amarr Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) following the election of a new
[Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ). The tradition arose following
the [Moral Reforms](48nuiRGJ4i8BwACDI9a58u), in order to minimize the
risk of conflict between the new Emperor and his old rivals. The
tradition has only twice been broken.

Origin
------

Prior to the Moral Reforms, the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) Emperor was
considered the first among equals on the [Council of Apostles](nTZLcvZprqLLUiGIaVQu7). The Emperor was more or less
a figurehead of power, chosen from among the Apostles by the other
Apostles, and in practice wielded essentially the same secular power as
his fellows. The Moral Reforms changed this, placing increasing
religious and secular powers in the hands of the Emperor, making him the
undisputed leader of the Empire. The Privy Council, which replaced the function of the
Council of Apostles, were subordinate to the Emperor and was composed of
the other claimants to the throne.

It was quickly realized that when the Emperor died, those claimants who
lost out would pose a threat to the new Emperor's power. Supporters of
the losers might cry foul and oppose particulars of the selection
process, or push their chosen to oppose the new Emperor. Opposition
would cause strife within the Empire at best, outright civil war at
worst.

Many solutions were proposed, but all had flaws. It was finally the head
of the Ardishapur Family that proposed
the ritual suicide. Drawing on old and then-obscure
[Scripture](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp), the suicide had a religious
precedent and would neatly solve all the problems. The losing claimants
would remove themselves entirely from the picture. Their deaths would
give the Emperor time to consolidate his power, much as the new Heirs
would be consolidating their own.

The Privy Council agreed that this drastic solution was the only way to
ensure that the Empire would not risk its own destruction with ever new
Emperor.

Breaks of Tradition
-------------------

Shathol'Syn has only been broken twice. The first was by [Garkeh Khanid](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf), the heir of the Khanid
Family, following the election of [Heideran Kador](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV) as Emperor. Garkeh had only recently
been made the Heir of Khanid Family and was a young, ambitious man.
A powerful Heir, he was considered the favorite to be elected Emperor.
When he lost, he refused to commit suicide, stating, 

> I will not be ordered ... to destroy myself when my work is unfinished. You will
> not take anything from me, ... least of all my life.

Instead, Garkeh declared himself Khanid II, King of the [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj), and seceded from the Empire. Though
this was the very thing Shathol'Syn was meant to avoid, little warfare
broke out, as Heideran VII and the new Heirs were busy strengthening
their own positions, leaving them unable to counterattack. The Empire
invaded later, but by then the Kingdom had dug in, making it virtually
impossible to conquer.

The second time was in YC110, by [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L). Believed dead following her loss of the
[Succession Trials](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx) to [Doriam Kor-Azor](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT) in YC105, Jamyl
returned from the dead to lead the Empire in defense of the invading
[Elder Fleet](7JAFwYwGqzvPv7yLIDlfjp). Jamyl had appeared to commit
suicide following Doriam II's coronation, self-destructing her ship.
Because of the doctrine of [Sacred Flesh](3k3re1JeaMxvvTRz3qARFv), it
was forbidden for Jamyl to clone herself. The
Sarum Family declared her return a miracle,
while her control of a mysterious super weapon and widespread popularity
made it difficult for others to challenge her. Eventually, she was
crowned Empress and cleared of wrongdoing by the Theology Council. There were still elements within
the Empire who believed Jamyl to be a heretic and false Empress, though
these kept their voices muffled for fear of reprisal.
