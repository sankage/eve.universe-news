A Jovian renegade, suspected to be in the early stages of the Jovian Disease, is on the run after he violated the non-interference law imposed by the Jovian directorate. The renegade gave away a hi-tech item to a person not an agent of the Jovian Empire. The directorate has already sentenced the rogue to the heaviest punishment possible, that of recycling his DNA upon capture. This is equivalent to removing the soul of a non-Jovian. It is also believed that the directorate is contemplating negating the effects of the renegade's crime, though how they plan to do this is yet unknown.
