Hek - Violence has struck the Minmatar Republic as the ripple effect from Karin Midular's decision to dissolve parliament spread throughout the nation. Protests against the lack of action to help the Starkmanir quickly escalated into a backlash against government officials, spurred on by fears of labor and supply shortages. Looting has been reported at numerous food silos, merchandise outlets and even government offices as riots flared in several major cities throughout the Minmatar Republic. In addition, spaceports in these cities are overwhelmed with congestion as those who can afford transportation attempt to leave the Republic for the Gallente Federation, which already accepts millions of Minmatar immigrants per year. 

Officials from the Republic Fleet, the only government branch unaffected by the turmoil, are urging people to remain calm and to refrain from spreading panic while "government processes are allowed to work."
