# Gilea Kiljaani
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/gilea-kiljaani

**Gilea Kiljaani** is a rich and rather amoral young woman. She smokes, and has a fondness for designer logos and expensive perfumes. At one point she was interested in having a procedure done called a [face-swap](4OVv2l5wpw0mh2pvDdFKSv), and had a long talk with Vertan Vejowin to that effect. Gilea, like most others briefly familiar with the procedure, believed erroneously that the person whose face she is choosing would be put to death after.
