# Space Industry
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/space-industry

**Space industry** is an ever-growing area of activity in 
[New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) for which startup companies
commonly require venture capital funding. It should be noted that New
Eden is host to thousands of solar systems, each of which houses
innumerable corporations who conduct their business primarily on the
surface of their own planets; going into space, far from being a given,
is in fact nowhere near an option for most of these.

It is possible to begin operating a space industrial company without
space facilities, particularly when gaining experience of operating
space craft and establishing contacts, but establishing industrial or
research facilities in space is a key step in developing such an
enterprise.
