Earlier this evening, Northern Coalition forces assaulted Legion of xXDEATHXx assets in the LXQ2-T solar system.  
  
At least 600 pilots in total were within the system during the assault as Legion of xXDEATHXx attempted to stop the Northern Coalition attack.

The outpost was placed into reinforced mode at approximately 20:10 New Eden time.  
  
Junior SvK, a NC fleet commander explained that, "we gathered 300 [pilots], we jumped to system via two gates in same time."  
  
Andrew Chikatilo, a member of the Legion of xXDEATHXx alliance told us that "pilots are happy that they got something to do during winter, without need to go 50 jumps from home to do some [combat]." Although unable to give us an official statement on behalf of his alliance, he mentioned from a personal perspective, "I know we will fight to the end."  
  
Northern Coalition members departed the system soon after the station was placed into reinforced mode, a member of the alliance, ATRIXOS, saying "WE WILL BE BACK" as the hundreds of pilots departed.  
  
Approximately 1500 ships and 500 pods were destroyed during the engagement.
