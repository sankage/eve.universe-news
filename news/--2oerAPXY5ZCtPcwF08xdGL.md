Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/eron

**Eron** was a captain in [Nedar](1UGa0FjGcs7ylRgIFW9mMx)'s squad of [Serpentis](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs) defense ships. Eron disapproved of Nedar's wife, [Scyldie](1moM3qDMYNHJULkvJkZ0Zr), meeting with a group called The Furies in an attempt to gain entry to their ranks and voiced his concerns to Nedar. Nedar framed him as a saboteur and Nedar's second, [Raze](2KvOppq2d1krzm2OT8z6I2), sabotaged Eron's ship in return, causing his ECM system to fail in battle with a capsuleer. His ship was destroyed, killing him.
