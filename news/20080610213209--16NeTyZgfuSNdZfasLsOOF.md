CEASE ALL NON-SANCTIONED COMBAT OPERATIONS IMMEDIATELY. 

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS MANDATE IS PUNISHABLE WITH DEADLY FORCE. DED AND CONCORD COUNTERTHREAT DEPLOYMENT CAPABILITIES HAVE BEEN RESTORED. 

REPEAT: CEASE ALL COMBAT OPERATIONS AND FALL BACK TO RECOGNIZED TERRITORIAL BOUNDARIES. 

TRAVEL ADVISORY – THREAT LEVEL CRITICAL 

MERCENARIES POSING AS MINMATAR REPUBLIC AND/OR THUKKER WARSHIPS HAVE BEEN SPOTTED NEAR THE MINMATAR/AMMATAR AND MINMATAR/AMARR BORDERS. THIS GROUP IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND WILL ATTACK WITHOUT PROVOCATION. CAPABLE FORCES ARE ENCOURAGED TO ENGAGE WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE.
