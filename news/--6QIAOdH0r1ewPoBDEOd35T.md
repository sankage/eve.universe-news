November, YC111
===============

Something Rotten in the Caldari State
-----------------------------------------------------------

Having been obliged to reorganize its operations by parent megacorp
[CBD](7o6AuVZhnq4lIzIMdYdMft) in the wake of the Kaunokka mining
blast, [Deep Core Mining Inc.](1H5H7H31pmuSXDnw1k6mvM) was able to
issue a strong earnings report at the beginning of November. In
contrast, [Hyasyoda Corporation](WisddAsk7hie3SUcwiNwa)
released poor sales figures for its Khanid region operations at the same
time that news that one of its senior executives in the Khanid division
of the megacorp had gone missing. Caldari corporate activity in the
[Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj) had long been a feature of
interstellar commerce. Only weeks before, Wiyrkomi Corporation had won a
contract with [Khanid Transport](2PWIy5vF0winaGW2sijcgD), and in
early November they were able to announce that they had secured a large
maintenance contract with the [Royal Khanid Navy](nQJFwBFQzGij9cZKKCrm7).

However, the news that seven [Hyasyoda](WisddAsk7hie3SUcwiNwa)
executives in its Khanid division had been charged with industrial
espionage by Hyasyoda's [Corporate Police Force](3WsVbe4z6a4RxknwTHMBTh) cast a rather different light
on Caldari corporate activity in the region. Suspicions fell on
[Wiyrkomi](66psXtrftjRzA7MyKHtb7K), rapidly expanding in the
Kingdom, and sources in [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) even hinted at the
involvement of the Patriot bloc megacorporation in the alleged espionage
against Hyasyoda. Nicknamed the "Seven Sleepers" the accused executives,
including the missing Attakaila Tatimon, were prosecuted under Hyasyoda
corporate law and eventually convicted. Their assets were seized by
Hyasyoda and they were sentenced to a life in a corporate labor camp.

If the apparent internecine warfare between Hyasyoda and Wiyrkomi in the
Khanid Kingdomwas a tellings sign that Caldari corporate life remained
red in tooth and claw, events in the Caldari State itself only
underlined the point the more. When the [Lai Dai Corporation](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT) opened its [Black Rise](black-rise) Development Conference in Kinakka, the
intent was to showcase and discuss the latest technologies for
colonization and exploitation of new and existing systems. Rumors of a
big announcement by Lai Dai at the keynote event circulated on the first
day. Whether such an announcement would have been made became moot when
the conference was struck by a massive electromagnetic pulse attack.
While there were no fatalities, a number of individuals were
hospitalized by the failure of personal cybernetic devices and
implants. Reports indicated that at
least 1.4 million ISK of damage was done to the station hosting the
conference and Lai Dai networks and data storage systems had been wiped
in the attack.

It became clear that Lai Dai were the primary target of the EM pulse
attack in Kinakka when a Lai Dai research facility in Ylandoki system
was destroyed by fire and a development facility in Innia system
suffered a catastrophic reactor emergency causing the loss of much
research. The pattern of attacks suggested a campaign of sabotage
against Lai Dai research and development efforts but Lai Dai themselves
refused to comment on the nature of the various research projects
affected by the incidents. In a coda to these November events, a
[Sukuuvestaa Corporation](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB) production
plant in the Arvasaras system suffered a series of explosions apparently
aimed at the Peace and Order Unit base within the station. It did appear
to many that corporate warfare in the Caldari State was back with a
vengeance after something of a lull following the
Provist revolution.

Mandate Matters
---------------

In the [Ammatar Mandate](4BV4ldw5RdVB4FxKctn4J6), Governor Ekroz
Salaf arrived in Tanoo system to take up his duties as head of the
[Ammatar Consulate](LxRVvJ2TIDlhoEWiTfKF2). Following some time
to familiarize himself with his new office, the new governor embarked on
an inspection tour of the Mandate. It may well be that on that tour the
governor found that, as reported, the orthodox [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
faith was increasingly supplanting the [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz)
Church in the Mandate. While the Ammatar Church remained a valid branch
of the Ammar religion, it was noted that many were abandoning the
Ammatar religious practises in favor of the Imperial rite of faith.

Gallente Election Gears Up
-------------------------------------------------

The Gallente Federation's presidential campaign overshadowed all other
news in the sprawling interstellar democracy and a new candidate emerged
in mid-November. Retired [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1)
Rear Admiral Daren Fasio announced his candidacy for the Gallente
presidency and quickly garnered the support of serving military
personnel who held a pro-Fasio rally in their off-duty time. However,
only days later, the [Senate](x8brOPuT22Bcly2Sikkt5) passed the
highly-controversial "No Vote" bill denying the right to vote in federal
elections to citizens living in Federation territory occupied by a
foreign power.

The 'No Vote' bill's immediate effect was to disenfranchise all those
Federation citizens living in Gallente systems occupied by the Caldari
State, including the [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn) system. While that
caused outrage, and played somewhat into the hands of Intaki
secessionists and pro-Caldari elements, it was clear that the decision
would stand and impact on the presidential election. While presidential
candidate Governor Celes Aguard drew record numbers to a holovisual
debate she participated in, analysts serious questioned whether she
would be able to achieve the necessary votes to win with the occupied
systems, a center of support for the Governor, denied the vote.
