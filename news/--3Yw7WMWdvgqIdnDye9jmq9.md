Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/rehydrator

The **rehydrator** is a machine that hooks up to the body via a series
of tubes. It monitors the needs of the patient and injects chemicals
whenever the person tries to do something, in order to limit damage. It
also can be used as a method of torture to inject pain-causing
chemicals.
