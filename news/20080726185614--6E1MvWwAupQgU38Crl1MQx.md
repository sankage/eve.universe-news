On the evening of the 25th, Against ALL Authorities alliance engaged a mixed fleet including members of Paxton Federation, Curatores Veritatis Alliance, Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate, and Sev3rance in SV5-8N. Reports indicate that as many as five -A- titans were involved. 

HED-GP is considered the beginning of the southern route from empire space into the regions of Catch, Stain, Esoteria and Paragon Soul; any alliance holding the corridor can wreak havoc on supply lines for other alliances. With SV5-8N only one jump from HED-GP, -A- had decided that the presence of a Paxton Federation control tower and possible jump bridge was too much of a threat to their supply lines. As one anonymous -A- pilot said “I don’t think it is in our best interests to allow a hostile group of this size to have a jump bridge near our logistics portal.”

Although Paxton owns the tower, several allies were called in to assist with the defense. When asked about his thoughts on -A-‘s attack, a CVA pilot remarked “It’s not theirs and we will defend whenever needed.” Apple Boy from IAC shared a similar sentiment, “CVA and Paxton asked for our help, we’re helping… that and it’s going to be one hell of a fight.” 

Despite severe spatial disruptions affecting navigational and weapon control, over 450 pilots attempted to do battle. The fight was split between conventional ships at the stargate to F9E-KX and capital ships at the tower. Although the allied fleet sustained heavier casualties at the stargate, the capital ship fight at the tower was more evenly matched. 

Early battlefield reports indicate 17 -A- dreadnoughts lost, and 14 allied dreadnoughts plus 3 carriers lost as well. Three -A- titans on the scene were not used, but two in a neighboring system successfully destroyed part of an allied battlegroup on its way to SV5-8N. 

With the successful destruction of the tower, the -A- fleet immediately left both battlefields.
