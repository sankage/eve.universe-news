### Drifters Attack Zarzakh Gate Systems
Drifters have launched an all-out attack on the four systems that contain stargates to Zarzakh. Zarzakh is a unique solar system in close proximity to a black hole, currently occupied by the Deathless Circle. It is only accessible via ancient Jovian gates which are located in four systems in distant reaches of New Eden. These systems are Turnur, Alsavoinon, H-PA29, and G-0Q86. Roaming Drifters have been detected in these gate systems along with Sleeper drones under their control.

As the attack began, deep space telemetry detected a massive warping of spacetime around Zarzakh itself. This warping has created a boundary through which no events can be observed. It is functionally the same as the event horizon around a black hole, except that selected energy and matter seem to be able to pass through it unimpeded. Reports out of Zarzakh have confirmed that there has been no change inside the system itself, or with the black hole present there. 

The Scope has reached out to the Society of Conscious Thought for insights into the ongoing events. SOCT CEO Idmei Sver has informed us that, “We are in the early days of trying to understand this new phenomenon. This is the first observed case of what we are dubbing a ‘Selective Hyperdimensional Event Horizon’ and at this point, its exact nature and origins remain unclear.”

In the gate systems, Drifters have attempted to activate stargates linked with Zarzakh. While these gates are still functional, the Drifter attempts have failed. This is the first time Drifters have been detected interacting with stargates. Idmei Sver has explained, “This is an indication that the Drifters are unable to use their typical wormhole transits to travel beyond the Horizon into Zarzakh. It is beyond doubt that Zarzakh itself is the Drifters' true target.”

Drifter forces in the besieged gate systems have deployed never-before-seen structures that are generating incredibly powerful spacetime-warping fields. SOCT telemetry indicates that these fields are attempting to disrupt, and ultimately breach, the Horizon. Designated as Horizon Breach Engines, the structures are under the control of a single Drifter, Tyrannos Tekton. “What we are witnessing,” Sver qualified “is a hyperspace siege.”

Capsuleers approaching the locations where engines have been deployed, called Horizon Siege Points, have received communications from one Malaya Hrada. Malaya Hrada is the caravanmaster of the Hrada-Oki, a Deathless Circle allied Thukker caravan. She appears to be hunkered down inside the Fulcrum along with many other Deathless operatives and is offering rewards to any capsuleers willing to disrupt the Drifters' efforts.

### The Drifters: Silent Tyrants
This attack, which began today on the 9th of September YC126, takes place over nine years since the Drifters first emerged in New Eden. While this siege is the first time there has been any sign of Drifter interest in Zarzakh, it is not the first time they have been connected with Jovian sites. In addition to the Jovian gates which provide its stargate connections, Zarzakh is home to the Fulcrum. The Fulcrum is a massive station of ancient Jovian design currently occupied by the Deathless Circle. 

The Drifters have shown great interest in Jovian Observatories, large structures whose reveal coincided with the Drifter emergence. The Drifters have also been connected with the Sleepers, an offshoot of the Second Jovian Empire that once called wormhole space its home. Drifters have been observed raiding Sleeper infrastructure left behind from an era prior to their exodus to wormhole space.

While all attempts to communicate with the Drifters have failed, data tags on Drifter vessels have revealed the names of some Drifter pilots, all of which include the word “Tyrannos”. They are also tagged as being part of a single organization; the Vigilant Tyrannos. The name implies a connection to the Tyrant enclave established by Miko Bour, the First Tyrant, which ruled over the second Jovian Empire. Drifters are extremely hostile and should be approached with caution.

### Emanation Lock Appears in Zarzakh
A source inside the Fulcrum has confirmed that its deep systems activated as the Horizon came into effect, causing speculation that the Fulcrum itself is its cause. 

At the same moment that the Horizon appeared, changes were observed in the behavior of the stargates inside Zarzakh. An effect identified as the “Emanation Lock” is being experienced by those who travel to Zarzakh. After entering Zarzakh, stargates now only allow exit back into the system from which a traveler originated. All other transits are barred by the Horizon. 

The current leading hypothesis is that this is an automated security response, protecting the system from any unchecked traffic. Early reports indicate that the Emanation Lock degrades over time and its effects are expected to end after six hours in the system, at which point the traveler is “naturalized” as a legitimate Zarzakh occupant and is once again free to exit through any gate.

The same sources have reported that the lock has thrown traffic through the system into chaos. This suggests that Deathless Circle operatives were as surprised by the appearance of the Emanation Lock as the rest of New Eden.

### News In Brief

- CONCORD responds to Zarzakh Siege, “as these attacks are targeting an illegal organization outside of CONCORD’s remit, no intervention is currently planned. We will however continue to monitor the situation as it unfolds.”

- SOCT observations indicate a reduction in energy signatures detected within Abyssal Deadspace, indicating a cessation in Deepflow conflict.

- Deepflow rifts are expected to disappear in a matter of days as the Abyss stabilizes.

- In the region of Pochven, Fraternity have destroyed an irreplaceable Astrahus belonging to Deepwater Hooligans.

- The Angel Cartel and their supporters have spread corruption into the system of Eredan, making the trade route between Amarr and Jita exceedingly dangerous. Capsuleers are advised to proceed with caution.

- Empress summons Amarr holders following failure to protect vital trade routes from insurgents.
