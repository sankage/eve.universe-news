ILLUIN - Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor confirmed that the Thukker caravan reported missing in the Great Wildlands has been destroyed. While declining to provide specific numbers, Shakor stated that a "significant and tragic loss of life was incurred" and that "they perished as a direct result of an anomalous solar event similar in scale and power to those described in Seyllin and the Syndicate region."

Shakor's announcement brings the total number of reported near-simultaneous mass-sequence anomalies in the last few hours to four, stoking popular fears that a widespread celestial armageddon is underway.
