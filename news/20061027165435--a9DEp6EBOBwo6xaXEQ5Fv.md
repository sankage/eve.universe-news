At 12:00 noon EVT today, polls for the Office of the Presidency opened in the five-hundred-twenty-eight voting districts of the Gallente Federation. With the projected turnout approaching 2.5 trillion voters, today’s election is shaping up to be one of the biggest in the Federation’s history.   
  
Booths have been opened in every major city and municipality across the Federation, and already citizens are flocking to cast their votes. Sepault Farina, analyst at the Center for Democratic Advance, a Sovicou political think-tank, touts today’s proceedings as the “grand finale of a drawn-out farce that has been going on for the better part of two years. One can scarcely believe it’s finally going to be over.”   
  
Preliminary numbers are unavailable at this point, but updates will be provided as the day progresses.
