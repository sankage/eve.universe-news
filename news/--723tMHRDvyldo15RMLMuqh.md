# Udorians
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/udorians

The **Udorians** are one of the many races conquered by the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo). They originated on [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4), along with the [True Amarr](2DkiJVfiL1RYP5y7AJGSNN) and [Khanid](1IRIdXfOZrfl5BuFuabOh6). Their arrival on [Amarr Island](4wZzhhUMIfR4ziHGaMOiLJ) is what spurred the launch of the [Reclaiming](70QLNGRwCwHUgmcjTmuhsA).

Though originally distinct from the True Amarr, they are now almost physically and socially identical, and impossible to tell apart. Their status is considered nearly equal to the True Amarr by all but the most conservative Amarr elements. One of the [royal houses](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh), the [Tash-Murkon Family](4t1KEOTA8LvYIHDcOtIPAb), is of Udorian heritage.
