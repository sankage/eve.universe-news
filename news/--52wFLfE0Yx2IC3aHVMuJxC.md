# Poire Viladillet
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/poire-viladillet

**Poire Viladillet** has been CEO of [Quafe Company](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6) for thirty-five years and has grown
the company from only one of several leading soft drink manufacturers to
a corporation that holds clear and undisputed market supremacy.

At one point he purchased Lost Stars, Inc, though he was too caught up
in developing Quafe Enterprises to discover what was occurring with that
company and their [Quafe+](7LIn9llI0ZBSXDQ1VxZr2g) product. He seems still
unaware of where [Gehyr Aillon](4kOfLWgkI7AR34IBxJc0I3) is, despite the
man's involvement.
