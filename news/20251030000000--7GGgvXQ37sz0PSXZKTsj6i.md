### Warnings Raised Over Drifter Wormhole Experiments
The Anoikis Mapping Project (AMP), a capsuleer-led initiative working with the Gallente Federation, has raised concerns over the experiments being carried out in occupied Drifter Wormholes. According to AMP, the occupiers' destructive testing of the Drifter’s hyperspace network threatens to destabilize New Eden.

The Anoikis Mapping Project is dedicated to the simultaneous monitoring of every single system in Anoikis, also known as Wormhole Space. AMP is reporting increasingly erratic hyperspace telemetry readings inside the Drifter Wormhole systems. They have published findings that suggest that if the current testing continues unabated, it may have unpredictable and disastrous long-term effects all across New Eden.

Five factions occupied Drifter Wormhole systems after successfully pushing back the Drifters during last year's Drifter Crisis. These factions are the Amarr Empire, the Caldari State, EDENCOM, the Minmatar Republic, and the Triglavian Collective. Since the end of the Crisis, they have been experimenting on the Drifter artifacts within each system, most notably the massive pillar formations that were the nexus points of Drifter activity during the Crisis' final stages. 

The exact nature of their research remains top secret, but it is known that the Drifter’s hyperspace network has been a key focus for all five wormhole occupiers. Their intensive testing of the network is in line with the suggestions of the Drifter Wormhole Summit held in Jita 4.4 last year, at which delegates from all five occupying factions promoted destructive testing of the network.

The AMP’s founder and patron, Rhysio Typho, has stated that they are “growing ever more concerned that those effects might spill over to known space”. Her concern has, however, been met with suspicion by the five occupying factions. Chairman Akimaka Saraki of the Caldari State went as far as to accuse the AMP of being a puppet of the Gallente President Aguard’s “failing administration, which is desperate to regain face after its failures in the Race for the Hives.” Rhysio Typho has responded with a willingness to share data with any who “pause their hyperspace network experiments immediately.”

Meanwhile, first signs have begun to emerge of practical applications for the research being carried out by occupying forces. Upwell, who have partnered with EDENCOM to assist in their research within the system of Sentinel MZ, have reported that breakthroughs are being made and they hope to showcase developments in the near future.
