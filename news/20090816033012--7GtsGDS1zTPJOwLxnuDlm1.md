 **2J-WJY, Catch** \- In the last 24 hours, the system of 2J-WJY has been the scene of several violent clashes, during which more than 1400 ships and 493 pods were lost.  
  
Preliminary reports indicate the fight began when two starbases and a cyno jammer belonging to Cold Steel Alliance were attacked by elements of Ushra'Khan and Against All Authorities. During the day-long fights the two towers were reportedly reinforced.[![The Damaged Tower in 2J-WJY](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3297/damagedtowerthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3297/damagedtower.png)  
  
According to Marcus Griffin, both the attacking and the defending fleet are mainly comprised of "sniper battleships with the usual logistics and tackle support". Cold Steel is presently receiving military support by Curatores Veritatis Alliance and the solar system seems secured.  
  
Seliana Tanis, of Against All Authorities, explained the reasons that motivated the attack on 2J-JWY's towers: "[they] were claiming [sovereignty] next door to our station system of ZXIC-7."  
  
Sapphrine of Ushra'Khan stated that the attack was initiated because: "they are expanding the reach of the slaver held Providence," adding that since 2J-WJY is only two jumps from Ushra'Khan's staging area, it made sense to include it among other strategic targets.  
  
Ramruqai of Curatores Veritatis Alliance, confirmed that the battle is not over: "These pirate scum that insist on destroying peaceful members of Project Deliverance must be removed as we get a chance to... We will respond to [Ushra'Khan]'s harassment where we can but their efforts to this day have been nothing but insignificant."
