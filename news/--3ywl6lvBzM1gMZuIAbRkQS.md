Considered selfish and self-centered, **Vania** was in a relationship
with [Melarius](77Fm8H3rm3bSlyTrcZ5YOK), the leader of the [Brothers of Freedom](1CfzDqtAmLd91V2NPTIB76). When she found out she was
pregnant with what would be a sickly child, and that Melarius'
assessment was that an abortion would be for the best, she contacted the
[Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) agents that have been trying to turn her.
