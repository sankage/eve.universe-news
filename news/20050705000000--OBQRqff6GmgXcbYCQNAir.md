Stunning news has just filtered out of the Amarr Empire. Doriam II, Emperor of Amarr, is dead at the hands of an unknown assailant.   
  
Details are still sketchy at this moment, but the Emperor's death has just been confirmed by the Imperial Chancellor's Office. The Privy Council has been called together to sit in emergency session.   
  
Chamberlain Karsoth, the acting regent, was visibly shaken when confronted by the media outside his office an hour ago. Nevertheless standing firm in his condemnation of the heinous act, he stated that the Empire would "spare nothing in hunting down the perpetrators, wherever they might hide."   
  
While the Chamberlain refused to confirm early rumors as to the killer's identity, he did state that "foreign elements will not succeed in spreading chaos and discord throughout our great empire." When asked to elaborate the Chamberlain declined to comment any further, instead urging his nation to "remain brave in the face of this unspeakable tragedy."   
  
The Imperial Navy has been put on full alert. All border areas are being closely watched, particularly those leading into Republic and Federation space, with emergency stargate reroute plans reportedly being put into effect.   
  
More news as they come in.
