Kor-Azor  \- Royal heir Aritcio Kor-Azor today announced several criminal pardons as part of a forgiveness package that marks the ascension of the new Empress, Jamyl I. The list of those pardoned includes a large number of non-violent criminals guilty of infractions against the noble holders of Kor-Azor domain, along with several debtor's prison inmates and minor blasphemers, all of which will be released or sent to ecclesiastical reform schools as befits their offenses.

Aritcio Kor-Azor went on to thank the holders under his rule for their support in this measure and willingness to forgive, adding that "my people have forgiven me the excesses of my former life, and I have been deeply touched by that forgiveness. Furthermore, the coronation of a new Empress should be a joyous occasion, so in the spirit of a bright new future I give this gift to my people."

While public reaction amongst the commoners was overwhelmingly positive, a number of Kor-Azor landholders have declined to comment upon the decision.
