### President and FIO Warn of Future Threat 

The Gallente Federation has declassified documents that they claim prove a major Drifter attack is on the horizon. These documents have been published as the “Forecaster Report” and contain details of Federal Intelligence Office operations into Drifter activities. The documents were shared following a joint announcement by President Celes Aguard and FIO Director Apaset Orviegnoure. 

According to President Aguard, the documents contain “evidence of a credible Drifter threat.” She explained that the fact the report had been made public was “a sign of how seriously I take the dangers Forecaster outlines and the importance of our preparations. When this attack will materialize is unclear, but that it is coming is undeniable”

Director Apaset Orviegnoure added that, “The FIO is dedicated to the security of our citizens first and foremost. The decision to publically share this information was not taken lightly, but President Aguard and I agree that hard choices will have to be made in the near future. For those choices to be successful the people of the Federation will have to understand the reasons behind them.”

Aguard finished the Press conference by adding “Our evidence strongly suggests that this coming crisis is the direct result of the Deathless Circles' irresponsible use of Jovian artifacts. From their occupation of The Fulcrum to their activation of the structure known as The Warden, their greed has put this cluster at risk. If it were not for their reckless actions the Drifter forces would have continued to remain dormant. As such, we will redouble our commitment to stamping out any Circle influence within Federation space.”

### Forecaster Documents Under the Microscope

The documents, which the Scope has carefully examined, are still heavily redacted. What has been shared begins with an investigation into Atavum following its retrieval by an FIO agent in October. The details of the operation along with the agent’s identity are redacted, with the codename “Wade” being their only identifier.

Following this operation, Gallente military scientists have been conducting an investigation into the Atavum and their hyperdimensional connection to The Warden. According to the declassified documents, the same connections that link the Atavum to the Warden shows signs of activity prior to periods of heightened Drifter deployments, such as their recent attacks on the Deathless-controlled Trustbreakers. Through means that have not been disclosed this has led the FIO to believe they can predict a large-scale attack coming in the future. These readings are also combined with reports of changes amongst Drifter and Drifter-controlled Sleeper drones inside wormholes. 

With much of the documents still redacted, it has not been possible for the Scope, or any institution we reached out to, to independently verify their results. That said, if accurate, the information contained within is certainly cause for alarm.

### Nations React to Forecaster Report

__Federation Election Postponed__

President Aguard has called an emergency Senate session. The session ended with the narrow passing of a vote to suspend the upcoming Presidential Election until the Drifter crisis has been resolved. The vote passed thanks to surprise support from the Labor-Populist. The Labor-Populist party has explained that “while we remain critical of President Aguard’s policies, the security of the Federation comes first.” 

Over the last year, Gallentia Primacy terrorist attacks led by former Labor-Populist senator Thibauld Tailler have damaged the party’s reputation. Recent polls suggest that if the election had gone ahead as scheduled, the Labor-Populists would have experienced a significant loss in seats.

__Empress Reaction Unclear__

The Amarrian Ministry of War and Ministry of Internal Order have issued official responses that they are “taking Forecaster under advisement”. Since the Siege of Zarzakh, concerns over rising Drifter activity have been raised within the Empire. These began when veterans of the Amarr-Drifter War petitioned the Empress. 

Royal Heir Hamideh Kador has joined their pleas, suggesting that the Empress “put the preservation of our people first”. Empress Catiz I has released a brief statement in which she assures the Amarr people that “their prosperity and safety are her highest priority.”

__Sanmatar Criticizes Federation__

Meanwhile, in the Minmatar Republic Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor has criticized the Gallente for “fostering panic”. At a public address in the Great Caravanserai, he assured the Minmatar people that “we remain vigilant, but at this time we see no need for immediate response.” 

Thukker Chief Ennar Aeboul called the Sanmatar’s address “bullish optimism”. Many of the caravans of the Thukker tribe, especially the Vo-Lakat, have observed changes in Drifter deployments that they contend indicate rising danger. The Sanmatar has stated in response that he appreciates the Thukker’s concerns, but that so far the recent Drifter activity has been entirely targeted at the Deathless Circle.

__Caldari Prepare Defensive Response__

In a surprise move, the Caldari State’s Chief Executive Panel has accepted the Federation’s warnings with swift and decisive action. On receiving the news, Chairman Akimaka Saraki called an emergency meeting of the CEP, and a motion to create a special task force was passed six to two. The Kaalakiota and Sukuuvestaa corporations of the Mountain faction were the only panel members to oppose the motion. Kaalakiota CEO Haatakan Oiritsuu called the motion “hasty” and stated that “such action should not be taken at the word of our oldest enemy”. 

Following the meeting, Chairman Akimaka Saraki read a statement saying that the “Survival of the State comes above all. While our war with the Federation continues, we have gathered our own evidence and believe the Drifter threat to be credible. It was not too long ago that another advanced and hostile group attacked our citizens and occupied our worlds. We will not risk such an outcome again, we will not let the cacophony of war deafen our ears to the rising winds.”
