BOURYNES - Scientists are rushing to collect data about the superheated mass heading toward Seyllin. Despite limited information, several theories have emerged, ranging from a massive vessel heading toward the planet to a gravitational distortion in the system; no consensus has been reached to completely explain the phenomenon, however.  
  
University of Caille scientists have urged anyone to contact them immediately with any data related to these events, including any information from systems affected by similar phenomena early today.
