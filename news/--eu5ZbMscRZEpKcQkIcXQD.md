# Clone Reanimation Unit
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/clone-reanimation-unit

The **clone reanimation unit** (CRU) is a medical chamber that switches
on the brain's mechanism for self-awareness and self-sustained organ
operation. It is not to be confused with the
[automated intensive care unit](6RGxbRbkkRUtx7s2RfESJ4). This process is not
started until personality and memory data has been uploaded into a
[clone's](2klMsyfd5quK05XnGL9wNB) brain.
