Sign ups for Alliance Tournament VII, scheduled for September have now opened, and Alliances can apply to enter from downtime on Friday, 03, July until downtime on Friday, 17, July. Full details and signup procedure can be found on the Alliance Tournament web site [here](http://www.eveonline.com/events/alliances/tournament/t7/signups.asp). Please note that, unlike previous Tournaments the process is no longer first come first serve, and everyone will have a chance to sign up over the next two weeks. The final teams will be decided by a random draw and announced. Make sure you take the time to fully read the sign up guidelines so as not to jeopardise your entry.
