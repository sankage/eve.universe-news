5ZXX-K - The Pure Blind region has erupted into full action as ships bearing Mordu's Legion insignias are converging from all corners to gather in force at their headquarters in 5ZXX-K. So far the Mordu's Legion has not yet declared their intentions as it gathers its strength. Rumours are flying around that the Caldari State has hired on the Legion to join their fleet. This has not been confirmed.
