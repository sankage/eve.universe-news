## Starkmanir Tribe
The __Starkmanir__ are a [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) tribe. They were thought lost in the [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N), until just prior to the Elder War when the [Sisters of EVE](77ihwsVRHRojCaPC5XZn2g) announced they had discovered remnants of the tribe within the [Ammatar Mandate](4BV4ldw5RdVB4FxKctn4J6).

### Culture

The Starkmanir are one of the oldest of the Minmatar tribes, and their access to abundant, readily-accessible resources meant that they were traditionally the largest as well. Despite this, due to the combined factors of the Starkmanir resettling on a planet subsequently destroyed, and the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) tendency to eradicate the culture of the people it conquers, less is known about Starkmanir society than any other tribe.

The Starkmanir's origin in the vast Eyniletti plains of [Matar's](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6) equatorial region is plainly visible even today in their almond-shaped eyes. Beyond that they appear very much like slightly smaller, darker, [Brutor](5xBrtZyeYfTxWkZTO1o5zg), and it is probably this trait that allowed the [Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2) to successfully hide the remnants of the tribe for so long. 

Currently in the Republic, they are viewed by some as simply a symbol of hope, while others just view them as backward or deluded by the Amarr faith. They struggle to come to terms with a foreign identity that they feel has suddenly been thrust upon them, while they try to make the transition from slaves to free citizens. The fact that many of the Starkmanir hold on to their Amarr faith isn't making their integration to the Republic any
smoother.
