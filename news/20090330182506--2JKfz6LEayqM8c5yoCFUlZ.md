_Jita - Ishukone announced that first quarter profits this year would be less than half what the corporation had predicted at the end of last quarter, triggering a sell off today. This punctuates a slight but steady decline that has set in over the last few weeks, which many analysts are attributing to the still-unresolved CEO issue._

_" It's been over two months since we heard rumors that the Ishukone board was about to pick Otro Gariushi's successor," said Asha Inaken, a contributing editor at ___The Kimotoro Report__ _. "Yet today, we don't seem to be any closer to a resolution than we were last year. Investors don't like the uncertainty with Ishukone running around headless; any decision would be better than no decision."_

_So far, Ishukone has declined any further comment on both the profit warnings and the CEO decision._
