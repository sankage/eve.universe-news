**Brater** is a former sailing ship captain. He had been married for a long time when he and his wife won a ship of their own from a contest sponsored by the largest corporation on the planet. During the launch ceremony, the ship accidentally activated, causing a part of the dock to collapse and sending Brater and his wife into the sea. Brater escaped, but his wife was crushed by the ship. Brater received a huge settlement from the corporation and retired, but was unable to return to sailing on the sea. Instead, he has been sitting and observes the "invisible waves" of space with his illegally modified ocular implant.

In a low-sec docking lounge he met [Tim](6yiD4pG8cwr9dOT3IiN86z), a missionary, and the two swapped stories. Brater revealed his plans to venture deeper into lowsec space on board a convoy, well aware that it might be shot down.
