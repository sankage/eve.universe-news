The empires have responded to the many requests for cheap alternative ways for space travel by launching space shuttles. These small vessels are only intended to ferry personnel between places and have no weaponry or other ship equipment. The shuttles offer a fast and efficient way to travel between distant places for a very small sum of money. Each of the empires have launched their own shuttle type, so all space farers should be able utilize these new machines. The first batch of space shuttles will arrive tomorrow.
