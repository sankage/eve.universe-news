The Curatores Veritatis Alliance [CVA], one of a handful of the oldest capsuleer alliances in New Eden, celebrated their fifth anniversary on 30.11.111.  
  
In Providence, a parade of the Golden Fleet could be seen on patrol in CVA controlled space. A Golden Fleet, according to GalNet, is a fleet of ships consisting of only Amarrian-hulled vessels, used extensively by Amarrian loyalist corporations. The fleet stopped for various speech opportunities along the way and among these speakers was Gangleri the CEO of 1st Praetorian Guard. His speech seemed to share the sentiments of the many well wishing pilots of New Eden, "Pilots of the Curatores Veritatis Alliance, you are a credit to Amarr, and a credit to your own illustrious name. You inspire us to greater things, all in the name of Amarr."  
  
CVA is an alliance loyal to the Amarrian Empire whose long-standing mandate has been to bring security to lawless space where the Amarrian Navy and CONCORD cannot. Through their "not red, don't shoot" policy, the CVA allows neutral pilots to operate on a limited basis in their controlled systems in the Providence region. This unique policy has enabled many new and veteran capsuleers to learn and profit from the harsh realities of lawless space while enjoying some measure of formal protection from the alliance itself.  
  
Even Ushra'Kahn [UNITY] offered up their respectful salutes to their long time enemies. Xious, of the Phase-9 corporation within UNITY was seen toasting the CVA on their accomplishment through GalNet, "Congratulations on five years on the field, here's to five more - preferably filled with lots of fighting."  
  
Of course not everyone shares Xious' point of view. Seriphyn Inhonores of Eleutherian Guard recently remarked, "CVA, I've found, is nothing but another power-hungry nullsec alliance that seeks to justify its existence by claiming to associate itself with the Empire, coating their activities behind the veil of God to make it seem righteous."  
  
Despite criticism, CVA has worked hard over the past five years trying to make nullsec accessible to neutral and friendly pilots alike. Only time will tell if they will be able to continue to do so for the benefit of current capsuleers and those to come.
