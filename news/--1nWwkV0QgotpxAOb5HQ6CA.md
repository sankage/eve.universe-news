# Year YC111
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/year-yc111

With the previous year having been such a historic period of upheaval
and change, the citizens of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk)
could be forgiven for hoping that **YC111** would be somewhat quieter
and allow the passions of war to cool. However, while nothing quite on
the scale of the June events of YC110 was to be seen, the year to come
would have more than its fair share of world-changing events. The wars
between the empires continued to rage, political re-alignments worked
themselves into new and ominous patterns, and to the peoples of New Eden
a wave of disruption and violence would seem to have been unleashed
across the cluster. A wave with the increasingly powerful capsuleer
class at its very peak.
