**Jania Bedtot** was an astrobiologist at [Outpost 4972](7lJLYLN8srQsuRHZJsCfVR). She is married to [Phaedan Bedtot](1FIeRYwZtgCNCVVrElQU7P) and has a daughter,
[Adara](38mR2djgLfz4rZhoNps85G). Jania claims her family is very
tight-knit, though there is some implication that she may be estranged
from her husband. She has had several articles published in
peer-reviewed journals, including from the [University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM).

Life at Outpost 4972
--------------------

Jania was a colleague of [Szekel](2KLlyAO4njOMOllcdmqgtv), a fellow
researcher. When an asteroid landed on the planet and was found to
contain archaea that interacted with the metal in the asteroid, she and
Szekel began researching it heavily. [Rakan Dep](1mJatucCrGapiHxzZQna6Y)
believed the two began an affair during their time in the labs. When
Szekel absconded with the data, Jania came under investigation by
corporate police. Though she denied involvement, she was ruthlessly
interrogated. The police eventually turned to torture and Jania
expressed extreme distress. She admitted to nothing, but eventually
agreed to call her husband to the planet, while begging for her daughter
to be left out of the entire event.
