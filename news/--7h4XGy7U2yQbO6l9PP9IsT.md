# Rokan
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/rokan

**Rokan** is adept at bypassing security protocols that generally
require complicated and expensive [AI](67UaJpJzvXXlhQc8a0GnWR) procedures to
break, considering such protocols to be "not a big deal." However, he
slips up during an attempt break into a high-security vault and ends up
the victim of a severe beating by the vault's guards.

Rokan is rescued by two mysterious men who introduce themselves only as
[Mister B](5TJ5WM6cJF9PkC4Mjdg07) and [Mister H](oozD2ZbqZvu1AGLUnlx1j).
They take Rokan to a private facility where they presume to pitch a job
to him on behalf of their employer, and unnamed
[capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ). Unbeknownst to Rokan, the pitch is
itself the beginning of the job, as Rokan finds himself being examined
and tested by a machine. His perception of his surroundings is altered
while Mister B and Mister H explain they are attempting to see if
Rokan's brain will handle the pressure of the interface.

Rokan 'volunteers' to be their research candidate but misses the
unsurprised reactions of his rescuers.
