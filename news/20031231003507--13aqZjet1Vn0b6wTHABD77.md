On the steps leading to the atrium at the Playboy Enterprises Offices at the Calle School at Egghelende, the press was at a fevered pitch upon the announcement of the Playmate of the Year.   
  
As Heff mounted the Podium dressed in his red smoking jacket, slippers surrounded by a bevy of beauties, all past winners of the monthly contest, a hush fell over the crowd.   
  
“I am very pleased to announce this year’s winner of the Playmate of the Year goes to Ms. Victoria Madison!”   
  
At that, the veiled red stain curtain fell from a gold encrusted easel to reveal Ms. Madison’s cover photo for the year end issue. This brings to a close a turbulent year for the Playboy after rumors of an internal investigation found charges of embezzlement and fraud leveled at some subordinates.   
  
“We have put that matter to an end and assure our readership that it was nothing more then an unauthorized drill by a few of our accounting staff. Those jokers just don’t know when to quit,” Heff stated at the after party.   
  
“The real star attraction is Ms. Madison,” said Heff. “She’ll have bragging rights for the whole year.”
