The first match of the day was called for time and The Interbus Initiative squeezed out the win by 1 point. In the second match, Prime Orbital Systems was disqualified from their fight due to multiple rule violations. The Gallente Factional Warfare Team also pulled the first flawless victory of the day.

More excitement is expected as the second day of qualifying continues.
