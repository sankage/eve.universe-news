### CONCORD Ruling Means Victory for Upwell

CONCORD’s Inner Circle has passed a motion declaring hardware infomorph transportation without a legal associated body a violation of the Yulai Accords. The decision was celebrated by the member corporations of the Upwell Consortium, all of which have been lobbying for the motion to pass. It is based on articles of the Yulai Accord introduced by the Jovian Directorate during the founding conference in YC0. These articles were inspired by the “one mind one body” principle, a key tenet of Jovian society. According to this principle, a sentient mind must always have a single associated body and each human body must be associated with no more than one mind. When an encrypted mind is transferred to physical storage illegally at Mercenary Dens its Upwell workforce body is lost. According to Upwell, this means that during the period of transportation, the mind has no legally associated body an is in violation of the Yulai Accords. This is different from, for example, warclone transit in which infomorphs are stored separate from their bodies, but an associated body legally exists.

The Jovian Directorate left the CONCORD Assembly during the Jovian departure of YC117. As the holders of their seats and critics of the Deathless Circle, The Society of Conscious Thought was delighted by the decision. “A founding principle of our shared civilization has been upheld,” said Elder Mentor Matshi Raish, the SOCT’s representative seat holder in CONCORD’s Inner Circle. “So often is our cluster divided, let us enjoy this moment and celebrate the essential humanity that unites us all.”

Legal scholars have expressed some concerns over the “hasty” ruling. According to Professor of Interstellar Law at the University of Caille Laura McLintock, “Today’s ruling could be the first step down a slippery slope. Now that transporting stored infomorphs is illegal, it opens the way for future challenges to backup clones.” CONCORD was quick to dismiss this claim when approached, stating that “it is false rhetoric to conflate these two entirely different cases.”

### Deathless Circle Scrambles to Release Merc Den Update
Over 4090 Merc Dens have reportedly been deployed since designs were first released by the Deathless earlier this month. The Informoph transportation law directly targets these Dens, where the extraction and transportation of Encrypted Infomorphs has been taking place. The Deathless Circle was quick to respond by broadcasting a firmware update to all Dens. 

This update appears to be based on the research into the Encrypted Infomorphs that have already requested passage to the Warden in Zarzakh. Following the update, the TEBS suites inside Merc Dens will no longer extract infomorphs onto physical storage, and will instead use the same kind of remote transfers employed by capsuleers. 

This method was previously impossible due to Upwell’s restrictive encryption but has now been unlocked with the usage of Infomorph Decryption keys. These decryption keys will be generated on-site at Mercenary Dens by noninvasive scans of workforce clones. The keys can then be uploaded to the Warden in Zarzakh, allowing it to decrypt infomorphs remotely as they are transferred. This will enable the successful remote transfer directly from the TEBS of any willing infomorph.

In addition to upgrading their transfer capabilities, the new Firmware has enabled Mercenary Dens to assign tactical operations. With these changes, the Scope expects that New Eden will continue to see den deployments despite Upwell’s legal victory.

### Deathless Trustbreakers Attacked

New Deathless “Trustbreaker” arrays have been spotted throughout pirate FOB systems. These sites which appear to be deployed by Deathless Wraith agents are actively hacking local PDNs (planetary defense networks). If these networks fail it would open up planets for ground assaults and manual overriding of terrestrial PDN systems. As such it is suspected that the Deathless' goal is to open up positions from Vanguard assaults. Whether these assaults will be carried out on the behalf of pirate insurgents or mercenary counter-pirate forces seems to vary widely, with the implication being that both sides of the conflict may be relying on the Deathless developed Vanguard warclones.

Spacetime fluctuations observed by SOCT initiatives indicate that many of these Trustbreakers are under attack from Drifter forces, perhaps caused by a remote link to the Warden in Zarzakh. Deathless Wraiths are offering rewards for support at these sites to pro-Deathless capsuleers, but these attacks also create opportunities for those who do not support the Deathless to target and destroy their infrastructure. CONCORD has issued an official statement urging capsuleers to “choose wisely and not assist in the slide towards chaos”.
