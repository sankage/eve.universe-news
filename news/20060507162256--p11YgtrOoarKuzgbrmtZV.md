Nine hours after the official announcement, Shin Ra and Heinky of Burn Eden managed to come up with solutions to all of the eleven riddles from Ruevo Aram’s will.  
  
Following the victory, a Caldari State official made this announcement: "As a part of our deal with Ruevo, we will honor his request and erect a statue commemorating the winners. May his soul rest in peace, and congratulations to Burn Eden."  
  
The whereabouts of the statue remain uncertain, although Jita is rumoured to have been chosen by the winners. In addition to the statue, each of them will receive three billion ISK from Ruevo’s will, as well as a commemorable Warp Core Stabilizer II.
