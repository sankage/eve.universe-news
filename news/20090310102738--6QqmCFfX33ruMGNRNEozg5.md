SEYLLIN 1008 - CONCORD has confirmed that "a natural disaster of unprecedented scale and consequence has occurred" and that a joint press conference with President Foiritan will be announced shortly. Dreadnoughts, carriers, and freighters have arrived by the hundreds at the stricken planet -- with even more en route -- to begin one of the largest mass rescue efforts in modern history.

A Navy spokesman stated that capital ships are ferrying dropship squadrons to be used in surface runs to evacuate the wounded, whereas freighters will provide fuel, supplies, and orbital triage centers. Stabilized patients will be transported from freighters to intensive care units throughout the Federation using "any and every means possible."
