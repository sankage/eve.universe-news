# Nedar
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/nedar

**Nedar** was a commander in the [Serpentis](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs)
military arm. He was in charge of a squad of ships sent to defend a
facility from a [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ). He schemed his way
into higher ranks with this assault, stabbing [Eron](2oerAPXY5ZCtPcwF08xdGL),
one of his own people, in the back by faking sabotage on his own ship to
incite his own second in command, [Raze](2KvOppq2d1krzm2OT8z6I2), to sabotage
Eron's ship, in turn causing his death against the capsuleer. His wife,
[Scyldie](1moM3qDMYNHJULkvJkZ0Zr), was meeting with the Furies around the
time of the capsuleer assault to discuss gaining entry to their ranks to
increase their combined power. Nedar had been having an affair of
convenience with a woman named [Aredia](7thNOgsrbTydOtSp7ooWs) to further
his own goal.
