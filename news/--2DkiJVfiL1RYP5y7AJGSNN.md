# True Amarr
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/true-amarr

The __True Amarr__ are the direct descendants of an ethnic group that conquered all the civilizations of its [home world](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4) - are proud and supercilious, with a great sense of tradition and ancestry. They are considered arrogant and tyrannical by most others. The [Empire's](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) defeat at the hands of the mysterious Jove, and the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) uprising that followed, left an indelible mark on Amarr culture. This double failure, a turning point in their history, has shaped an entire generation of policy and philosophy among the imperial elite.

Racial Traits
-------------

Amarr males tend to be condescending towards those without faith, and
possess an unflagging belief in their own superiority. Although a clear
hindrance to conducting international business, it still affords them
with fortitude and a great sense of purpose. Capable of bringing
unwavering focus to bear on issues, they are outstanding planners, and
their composure gives them the perseverance to see their plans to
fruition.

Amarr females tend to be class-conscious and formal in their dealings
with others. Masters of subterfuge and machination, they forgive little
and forget nothing. They are natural matriarchs who are fiercely
protective of loved ones and obsessed with preserving the integrity of
their family name. For the Amarr female, the family bond is sacred and
unbreakable, persisting across generations.

Ancestry
--------

### Religious Reclaimers

Many Amarr still dream of the glory days of the Empire, when it seemed
that no power in the cluster could defy the will of the Empire. They
abhor the conciliatory policies of recent regimes, regarding them as
weak and counter to everything the Empire has stood for in its
magnificent history.

### Liberal Holders

[Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v), the major landholding class in Amarr society, are generally conservative traditionalists. A few, however,
have elected to break ranks with their hidebound and power-hungry peers, instead supporting the modernization of their society's religion and substantial economic reform. Their champion is [Catiz Tash-Murkon](5sw0sEytwzlBUbKWdiisUI), the [Udorian](723tMHRDvyldo15RMLMuqh) [Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh).

### Wealthy Commoners

Some commoners manage to break out of Amarr society's rigid class divisions and carve out an elevated niche for themselves, usually
through trade or other mercantile activities. Though they can never attain political office within the empire, they are free to accrue vast amounts of wealth - along with no small measure of power and influence - through interstellar trade.
