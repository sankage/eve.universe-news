# Planetary Mining
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/planetary-mining

**Planetary mining** of uninhabited planets and moons is vitally
important in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) for any
manufacturing station that wants to compete on equal footing with
[stations](Space-stations) orbiting inhabited planets.

Although such stations do occasionally exist without the support of a
mineral rich stellar body, they must then rely on minerals being
transported to them, which is always more cumbersome and expensive. This
has made uninhabited but mineral-rich planets gold mines - often in the
literal sense - for anyone aspiring to large-scale manufacturing.
