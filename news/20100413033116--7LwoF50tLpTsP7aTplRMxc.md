 **Teonusude, Molden Heath** \- The pro-Minmatar T.R.I.A.D. corporation's mission agency, which first opened in 108, has expanded its offerings to include multi-pilot combat "campaigns" in the areas contested between the Minmatar and Amarr capsuleer militias.  
  
Det Resprox, CEO of T.R.I.A.D, described his operation: "T.R.I.A.D is offering missions to all members of all corps, in particular the Minmatar militia as an alternative way of gaining loyalty points, ISK and items for killing the Amarr." The agency offers three different types of mission through their portal: 'Marketing,' 'Combat' and 'Campaign.'  
  
According to Det Resprox, the new 'Campaign' missions can be taken on by any registered agency member. Once a pilot accepts a 'Campaign', he becomes its fleet commander and other agency pilots can join the mission, which could take hours or days to complete depending on the opposition fielded. Rewards, including T.R.I.A.D. loyalty points, are paid to each member of a given campaign. These loyalty points can be exchanged for faction technology as well as tech 2 and officer-grade items.  
  
Det Resprox said that the next step for the agency will be the introduction of so-called "Epic Arcs" which will assign a pilot to chains of missions, each contributing towards a greater goal.  
  
Det Resprox said that T.R.I.A.D. offers missions against the Amarr and pirates in Minmatar Republic space, including efforts against the 24th Imperial Crusade and other Amarr militia corporations such as PIE Inc. "Anti-piracy-wise we are focusing on Heimatar, in particular piracy in Amamake and further out near Gusandall."  
  
PIE Inc is one of the corporations T.R.I.A.D. missions have targeted, both for their long-term stance as Amarr loyalists and for their role in the 24th Imperial Crusade, where they were the first corporation to be awarded 1 million "victory points." Rodj Blake, Director and diplomat for PIE Inc had a few comments concerning the subject, "As I understand things, their mission system has only had limited impact, although I must confess that I'm unaware of what they've done with their missions other than effectively buy slaves. It seems to me that one could complete such a mission by simply buying the slaves on the market... what these TRIAD types are doing is nothing more than promoting kidnapping."  
  
As for T.R.I.A.D. and particularly those PIE enemies that run the missions, Rodj said; "their fate will be the same as that of all terrorists - they will be brought to justice. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but one day, they will answer for their crimes."
