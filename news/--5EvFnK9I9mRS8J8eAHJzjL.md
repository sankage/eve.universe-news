# Fedo Fighting
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/fedo-fighting

**Fedo fighting** is a bloodsport where female [fedos](1ZTrrDLEL9V2OvHNc8NMkY) have been bred and forced to fight in certain [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) establishments for entertainment. Their noxious fumes were modified by unscrupulous breeders who fed them on special diets in order to produce toxic gases to fight each other. An illegal multi-million ISK gambling ring was smashed by the [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) after complaints from Gallente ethical lobbyists.
