# Yanou Latuere
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/yanou-latuere

**Yanou Latuere** was the first [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) ambassador to the [Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo). He served as the ambassador for many years, spending at least several years living in the city of [Dam-Torsad](UI6KVmdCZ0H42EvHijFVZ).

Latuere's time among the Amarr led him to loathe them, later describing them in his autobiography in numerous unflattering terms. Despite his distaste for the Amarr and their society, he was also in awe of their progress.
