Researches on rogue drone technology and behavioural patterns are requesting the help of pod-pilots on one of their field research projects.   
  
Dr. Palask and Dr. Stubbs from Independent Studies Corporation have been carrying out diverse studies on the Amod Rogue Drone hive for the last week; according to Dr. Stubbs the research team located a number of “interesting technologies” inside, yet was for the moment unable to reach them for lack of enough combat forces to keep the Rogue Drones at bay.   
  
The Hive is rated 5/10 by CONCORD; IS corporation is on the lookout for pod-pilots capable of providing the firepower to allow IS scanning units reach the structures in question.
