In a surprise statement released today, the Aidonis Foundation has revealed the next receiver of the coveted Aidonis Statue. The Statue is rewarded annually to those that have contributed greatly to inter-stellar peace and improved empire relations. This is the first time the Statue is awarded to a national leader still in power, but most political analysts agree that Heideran more than deserves the award, as he is without doubt the main reason for the thaw in relations between the empires in recent years and, hence, the fabulous prosperity now enjoyed by everyone throughout the world of EVE.
