Nonni - State Executor Tibus Heth has ordered the creation of the "State Loyalty Tribunal," an independent committee tasked with investigating national security threats within the highest ranks of Caldari corporate and political power. "Recent events have made it clear that our enemies seek to subvert the State at every level," said Heth. "The State Loyalty Tribunal will bring an end to this and prevent further infiltration."

Asiaineras Isuki, commander of the Home Guard's Surveillance Division, has been appointed to fill the chairman's seat for the new Tribunal. The other members of the committee have not yet been announced, but insiders tell the Scope that they will likely be selected from the ranks of the Caldari Providence Directorate and Patriot-bloc megacorporate security forces.

So far, Lai Dai and Wiyrkomi have pledged to cooperate with the new body, but the other megacorporations have so far declined to comment publicly. Privately, sources at Hyasyoda and Nugoeihuvi have told the Scope that they perceive this as yet another attempt by Heth to encroach upon corporate sovereignty, and that they are preparing legal challenges should the State Loyalty Tribunal target their employees.
