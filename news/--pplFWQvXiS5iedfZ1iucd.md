# Organic Camouflage
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/organic-camouflage

**Organic camouflage** may be used not only to disguise humans, but
actual places and locations. Not only that, but they can be deployed in
conjunction with other, hidden systems for access control.

For instance, there exists a form of hidden passageway that may be
passed through only by specific individuals. Passing through it is
described as entering a porous membrane that melds with you and ripples
and moves to let you through. It should be noted that the passageway's
disguise is purely chameolonic, and not a hologram.
