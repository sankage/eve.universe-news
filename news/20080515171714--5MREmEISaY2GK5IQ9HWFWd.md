A spokesman for the Chief Executive Panel has admitted that the communications network in the Caldari State is under ‘severe strain’ following the news of the disaster at Malkalen.

Channels have been swamped by a massive increase in data being transferred across them. Many of the transmissions are from concerned relatives and friends; however it is clear that a high proportion of the bandwidth is being taken up by The Scope and other independent news agencies.

Officials appealed for calm; “The system has been operating at peak traffic for a number of hours now. We hope people remain calm and wait for press releases through the correct channels. The worst thing that the public could do at this time is to further endanger an already serious situation by rumour mongers clogging up our communications networks with conspiracy theories.”
