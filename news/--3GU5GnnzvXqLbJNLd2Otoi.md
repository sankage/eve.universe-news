Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/arzad

Arzad is a solar system. It is home to Arzad II,
once known as [Starkman Prime](hhT3DOiMGuhLQl0vmNbuY) and ancestral
home of the [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw).

Arzad II
--------

Arzad II was once a hot temperate world, but it underwent disastrous
climate changes as the result of orbital bombardment. Once known as
Starkman Prime, it was the capital world of the Starkmanir tribe. As a
result of intervention by royal [Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) [Idonis Ardishapur](2ZNvkPaPzpj4IaVpL2vWK3), the planet was declared an
Imperial Protectorate (see Khadrea's Law), although the world is not
subject to Imperial Law.

Hidden Hope
-----------

Hidden Hope (or Vo'shun) is a population center situated within a deep
ravine carved into the planet's surface by orbital weapons systems. This
is one of the few remaining inhabited places on Arzad II and is perhaps
one of the most lawless settlements in the universe.
