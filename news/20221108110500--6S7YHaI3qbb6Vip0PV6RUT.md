## BREAKING - Massive Cynosural Activity Detected in Placid Region

Placid Region â€“ Large-scale cynosural beacon activity has been detected in the Placid region, apparently centered on the Intaki system, according to reports confirmed by the Scope in the last few moments.

Cynosural activity seems to be at its most intense in the Intaki system but has been detected in a broad swathe of Placid systems bordering the Verge Vendor and Syndicate regions.

It is unclear at this time who or what is the source of this unprecedented massive cynosural activity in systems subject to militia warzone fighting between the Federation and State. Although these systems are considered Gallente Federation territory by virtue of the Yulai Accords and Convention many have been under extended occupation by the Caldari State's forces.

The Scope will continue monitoring this rapidly developing situation.
