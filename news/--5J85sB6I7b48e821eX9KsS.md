# Neuro-Embryonic Containment Fluid
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/neuro-embryonic-containment-fluid

**Neuro-embryonic containment fluid** is the substance inside of
[pods](capsule-lore) that protects the
[capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ). In addition to providing biological
sustenance and a natural hyperconductor of brain wave electrical
activity, the fluid contains unique graviton induction/convergence
properties that, when combined with the inner-capsule shell membrane,
behaves as an inertia dampener, allowing the pilot to perform high-G
maneuvers in space.
