SEYLLIN - SCOPE News has established a live feed of the remnants of Seyllin I. The hellish scene confirms that a plasma wave passed through the area, and that the planet's remains are coalescing back into sphere. Massive fragments are still orbiting the world, and capsuller traffic has been sighted inspecting the remains.  
   
CONCORD maintains that the area surrounding the planet is extremely dangerous, and should be approached with caution.
