# Year YC108
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/year-yc108

January
-------

A quiet New Year period
was disturbed by rumors in early January of mysterious trading cartels
buying up commodities in [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) hubs. As
the month wore on the renegade scientists Albery Vance and Victor Stats- last seen evading capture after a their prototype 'brain control'
device failed- were said to have been sighted in the Isaziwa system of
the Citadel region. This sighting was confirmed when Dr. Vance appeared
in the Saila system and claimed to be close to finishing a second,
functioning, 'brain wave control' device. Quite what happened to the
bizarre pair of scientists after these appearances is a mystery for the
two were never seen again, their activities becoming fodder for
conspiracy theories for months to come.

The ever- controversial [Order of St. Tetrimon](4Z9IYnlIENaSBblXROhEfY) was the subject of much
speculation later in the month when the [Privy Council](privy-council) lifted the edict of suppression
against the heterodox order, allowing it to openly return to the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo). Evidently acting on the recommendation of the
Theology Council, the Privy Councilors appeared to have had their hand
forced by the results of a study of the so-called "Tetrimon
[Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp)" - delivered to the [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) over a year earlier - by
archivists of the supreme religious body. For its part, the Theology
Council, headed by Arch Deacon [Mervan Moritok](62uL39LYMcFWZn6LqgdoNw), declined to comment on the
suspension of the edict.

February
--------

The [Serpentis Corporation](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs) stepped up its
operations, despite the loss of a carrier to independent capsuleers in
Delve, and by February was clearly aiming at taking control of the
[Outer Ring Excavations](38pEfgwJxyeFUuqMgpTLZ) (ORE)
conglomerate. However, the month was dominated by the Reschard V
Disaster, an explosion in the atmosphere of that planet that devastated
its entire surface. [CONCORD's](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) analysis of system
scanners showed that a capital-class vessel was in low orbit moments
before the explosion, and speculation was rife as to the possibility
that a new weapons system had been tested on the ill-fortuned planet.

Concern over the disaster itself turned to outrage when a relief convoy
organized by the Servant [Sisters of EVE](77ihwsVRHRojCaPC5XZn2g) was
set upon by capsuleers of the IRON alliance. A running battle between
the convoy's [Mordu's Legion](5csCeDqUe1exvVyfPdL75Q) escorts and the
[capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) raiders ensued, with damage to an SOE
freighter possibly resulting in its destruction by critical drive
malfunction in Reschard system. Others claimed the freighter had been
sabotaged, raising disturbing questions given its mission of mercy.

March
-----

March brought news that the trend of [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)
emigrating from the Republic to the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) was showing signs of rising, prompting
concerns of overcrowding in some destination systems. The Gallente were
not alone in being concerned by the situation, with Minmatar analysts
pointing to labor shortages and declining industrial output in the
Republic.

A terrorist strike by Minmatar capsuleers succeeded in assassinating
[Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) Jamir Torash, leaving House Torash
leaderless. Some Amarr pointed to the fact that Holder Torash's convoy
was carrying large quantities of [Vitoc](4HUZbTn03CVY7jskAAE4qx), and
linked the attack to critical shortages of the substance among immigrant
Minmatar in the Gallente Federation.

More positively, the Federation's University of Caille announced plans
by its Department of Archaeology to explore the Crux constellation in
search of ancient ruins. In further happy news, the
[Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn) Reborn and philosopher Vremaja Idama
announced his marriage to Vika Kuvakei, daughter of a renowned Caldari
patriot.

April
-----

With the Serpentis Corporation enmeshing ORE ever more securely in its
coils, April had in store stunning news for the Gallente Federation, and
not only in the form of ORE capitulating to the underworld corporation
as it divested private and legal stockholders of any control over its
operations. Remarkable as the events in Outer Ring were, with CONCORD's
DED promising to use deadly force if the Serpentis expanded any closer
to the borders of the Federation, later political developments were to
push them into the background so far as Federation citizens were
concerned.

The Minmatar [Republic Fleet](2c4ZwKPnuW6mYkLJ2dGh94) celebrated the career of one of its
most distinguished pilots by awarding the Drupar's Sun, one of its most
prestigious medals, to Captain Karishal Muritor. In addition to his
decoration, Muritor was promoted from Captain to Captain 1st Class,
making him the youngest man to hold that senior rank in the history of
the Fleet.

With the Gallente Federation [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E)
election campaign well under way, presidential candidate Eman Autrech
shocked the nation by withdrawing from the race, leaving incumbent
[Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) to fight his only remaining
challenger, Senator [Mentas Blaque](1bZzUGejHEhyHp6LVUtjBT). Dismayed
members of the Autrech campaign were unable to shed much light on the
surprise withdrawal and conspiracy theorists were not slow to conjure up
suspicions about the former candidate's reasons. President Foiritan
refrained from politicking over the matter and paid a warm tribute to
Autrech, describing his withdrawal as a 'blow to democracy.'. Mentas
Blaque was rather more waspish in his remarks on the matter, describing
Autrech as 'reneging on his duties.'

May
---

The Gallente
elections continued to produce controversy in May when Mentas Blaque
visited the city of [Hueromont](1PzpjLA0ZHtQRZu2f8x4gO) on [Gallente Prime](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a), ostensibly to commemorate those
Gallenteans who had died there when the Caldari Admiral [Yakiya Tovil-Toba](RsUoECrk1bkV0t35D4sDE) flew his carrier into the
planet's atmosphere during the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV). Using the occasion to deliver a
speech urging vigilance on the part of Federation citizens and reminding
his audience of their duty to safeguard the 'homeland' Blaque was
accused by liberal commentators of being deliberately inflammatory. Some
saw the resignation soon afterwards of Intaki spiritual leader Vremaja
Idama from his lecturing post at the [University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM) as connected with Blaque's
speech, pointing to his recent marriage to the Caldari Vika Kuvakei.

In the Amarr Empire, House Torash regained stability with the
announcement that Gavit Torash was to take the place of his assassinated
father, Jamir, as the Torash Holder. Citizens of the Minmatar Republic
were disturbed by the fall from grace of Captain 1st Class Karishal
Muritor, as Republic Fleet command denied him permission to take a task
force into Molden Heath in order to 'pacify' the region, after he had
lost an entire patrol to renegade capsuleers. In the State, the Caldari
Gaming Commission announced that it would be holding a second capsuleer
Alliance Tournament, arousing much speculation as to the rules and
format.

The Order of St. Tetrimon lived up to its controversial reputation when
it engaged in a large-scale battle with the [Blood Raider](7obiU8rOyJkPZ3S0Faxc5W) Covenant at the end of the month,
reportedly retrieving several artifacts plundered by the Raiders from a
temple in the Genesis region.

June
----

Its interest aroused by the activities of the Tetrimon, the Amarr Privy
Council ordered an investigation in June into the temple from which the
artifacts recovered by the Order allegedly came. The relics in question,
a number of holy statues connected with the Amarr concept of the
Reclaiming, attracted considerable attention from scholars and
theologians, particularly those Theology Council archivists studying the
'Tetrimon Scriptures' that led to the Order being allowed to return to
the Empire.

Embarrassingly for the Republic Fleet, a supercarrier-class vessel, the
Alfhild, went missing, amid fears it had been stolen by Captain Karishal
Muritor, in the middle of June. This was accompanied by the mobilization
without authority of other capital-class vessels and numerous subcapital
heavy ships.

Throughout
the month, Mentas Blaque basked in high approval ratings as he continued
to make controversial speeches on the Presidential campaign trail. The
Caldari [Chief Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr)
criticized him for seeking to inflame passions concerning
Caldari-Gallente relations but possibly did more good for Blaque's
ratings than anything else. The Caldari Gaming Commission opened
sign-ups for the Second Alliance Tournament and announced the tournament
format was changing to a group system for the initial matches.

July
----

The Minmatar Republic was placed in the position of declaring the senior
Republic Fleet Captain Karishal Muritor an outlaw on the first day of
July. Confirmation that Muritor was in control of the stolen Republic
Fleet supercarrier Alfhild, and its escort carriers Magni and Modi, came
with news that the highly-decorated officer was no longer a member of
the Republic Fleet and had formed a dissident group named 'The
[Defiants](6aq75j8f7bMZckaqXWXSC6)'. [Amarr Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g)
commanders, assuming the Defiants meant to raid into the Amarr Empire,
expressed skepticism about the Republic's willingness to bring Muritor
to justice, despite the dispatch of a task force under Vice-Admiral
Kanth Filmir for this stated purpose.

The latter
half of the month was dominated by coverage of the Second Alliance
Tournament, with the Mercenary Coalition being beaten for a final spot
by the Band of Brothers, while Ascendant Frontier defeated Interstellar
Alcohol Conglomerate for its place in the championship match. A very
hard- fought match between the teams of the two powerhouses resulted in
the Band of Brothers retaining their title.

August
------

Since returning to the Amarr Empire, the Order of St. Tetrimon seemed to
have been courting publicity whenever it could. In August this continued
when the Order petitioned the Theology Council to remove the privileges
granted by the Cross of the Sacred Throne to Golan Trevize on the basis
that the capsuleer's mercenary activities meant he was no longer worthy
of the honor.

Speculation as to the motives of Tetrimon Grand Master Horm was
immediate and considerable, with some believing the petition was an
attack on the [Cross of the Sacred Throne Order](3PkiBQG9h14kCrM9qRrInk) itself, and thus by
proxy an attack on the very basis of the Emperor system. Others believed
that the petition was intended to distract and disrupt the Theology
Council. Whatever his view of the matter, council member Deacon Lorenzo
Azir called for the petition to be dismissed immediately on the grounds
it had not been offered in private.

September
---------

The theft by the Defiants of a Minmatar
Republic supercarrier was serious enough but in September the Serpentis
Corporation emulated the act, with their own Admiral Siral stealing a
Federation Navy supercarrier from its moorings in the Luminaire system.
Rapidly alerted, CONCORD forces called on capsuleers in Luminaire to
disable the warship before it could jump away. Confusion and hesitation
allowed Admiral Siral to jump his prize to the PFP-GU system. There
Siral attacked a lone capsuleer he chanced upon and this pilot alerted
his allies. A substantial fleet of independent capsuleers then descended
on PFP-GU and destroyed the stolen Nyx-class vessel.

The theft of capitals was shown to have turned into something of a trend
when the renegade Ultra Unionist Movement attempted to steal a carrier
destined for the [Royal Khanid Navy](nQJFwBFQzGij9cZKKCrm7) from
military contractors Dark Amarr Creations. The radicals were thwarted by
elements of the Royal Khanid Navy, including a Revalation-class
Dreadnought and a large force of Khanid loyalist capsuleers which
numbered among them, two Archon-class carriers.

Rescue ships were finally able to land on the devastated surface of
Reschard V, seven months after the disaster that struck the planet, as
the megastorms that had constantly swept through the atmosphere abated.
Led by the Servant Sisters of EVE, the rescue teams were able to
discover around 2,000 survivors sheltering in deep caves Investigators
also announced progress in determining the cause of the disaster. Deep
analysis of scanning telemetry was able to confirm the presence in
low-orbit of an Avatar-class [Titan](XH5ZPvSBGGIStAEWqWHOl) moments before
the explosion that blasted the planet. The nature of this explosion and
residual energy readings confirmed that it had in all likelihood been
the detonation of a 'Judgement' doomsday weapon, as carried by Avatars.
Unfortunately, it had proved impossible to track the capital ship due to
the large number of open cynosural fields in the [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) cluster at the time of the
disaster.

The Serpentis Corporation seemed unbowed by its failure to successfully
steal away a Federation supercarrier and continued its consolidation of
control over the Outer Rings Excavations (ORE) combine. In a surprise
move, the Serpentis appointed former ORE station administrator Fazin
Oorund to the rank of Lord Admiral with responsibility for liaising
between the Serpentis Corporation and ORE.

October
-------

After a long, hard-fought and considerably drawn- out campaign, October
would finally see polling day in the Gallente Federation Presidential
elections. Having been riding high in the polls for some months the
challenger, Senator Mentas Blaque, continued to lead as the month
opened. With election day falling on the 27th, there were several weeks
of campaigning still to go before the final result.

In the Caldari State, the Chief Executive Panel vehemently refuted
claims by the noted economist Arvelan Tokaru that the State was headed
for a deep recession. Citing heavy-handed tariffs and other forms of
protectionism, Dr. Tokaru warned that the State ran the risk of
alienating trading partners and losing out in competition for foreign
markets in the long run.

The Order of St. Tetrimon suffered a grave setback when an Imperial Navy
fleet, containing numerous capitals, destroyed a large Tetrimon
installation on the orders of the Theology Council. Deacon Lorenzo Azir,
representing the Theology Council, accused the Order of spying on the
Council and oversaw the destruction of the facility, believed to be a
signals intelligence station used by the Order in their espionage.
Observers of the Amarr Empire suggested that the incident showed the
Theology Council had lost patience with the Order of St. Tetrimon and
that the edict of suppression against the Order could be reinstated at
any time.

As scheduled, the polls opened
across the Gallente Federation on the 27th as the Presidential elections
got underway in 528 voting districts. Early polling figures continued to
show Mentas Blaque leading incumbent President Souro Foiritan. By the
evening, with 233 districts counted, this lead appeared to be a solid
five-point margin. However, as the border regions returned their voting
data the count showed Foiritan gaining a full three points on his
challenger. Remarkably, the final results showed President Foiritan's
electoral base rally and give him a single point victory over Senator
Blaque. His re-election made him the first two-term President in the
history of the Gallente Federation.

November
--------

In November, as expected, the Privy Council of the Amarr Empire
reinstated the edict of suppression against the Order of St. Tetrimon,
sending the radical cult back into exile. The month also saw attacks on
Amarrian holdings in [the Bleak Lands](1thJ31aFnpCVAbE0rkntPP) flare
up again, with Holders in the troubled region complaining that the
Imperial Navy was giving them little assistance.

A major incident erupted in the Caldari State, as rioting at the Truissu
Station [mining colony](6NQhah6uyVb1Bzg0ifUe5N) on Kassigainen IV
resulted in bloodshed when [Home Guard](6ajQ0UPFl2qdootvjTwjG) security
forces used deadly force to beat the rioters back. Amidst allegations
that the Home Guard had provoked the rioting by brutally killing a
miner, it became clear that dozens had died when the riots were put
down. The Home Guard's parent megacorporation
[Kaalakiota Corporation](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK) ascribed the rioting to
disaffected elements seeking to cause trouble and disputed claims that
Home Guard officers had triggered the incident.

Perhaps seeking to flex his diplomatic muscles in the afterglow of his
re-election, President Souro Foiritan sent an aid convoy to Kassigainen
as a gesture of goodwill. The initiative backfired badly when the convoy
was shot down by capsuleer pirates after Home Guard refused it
permission to land at Truiisu Station. With Kassigainen now assuming the
proportions of an international incident, Kaalakiota and Home Guard
insisted the situation was under control, despite heavy criticism from
the Gallente Federation as the final death toll was reported to be over
400.

If capsuleers welcomed the news that the Caldari Gaming Commission
intended to hold its Third Alliance Tournament at the end of the year,
they were startled when a number of offline stargates across New Eden
spontaneously reactivated. Tentative explorations indicated that as many
as eight previously closed-off regions could now be accessed. CONCORD
warned that the new regions should not be entered due to unspecified
dangers, but were largely ignored by the capsuleer population. It was
soon discovered that the regions were heavily- populated by rogue
drones, leading many to call them the 'Drone Regions.'

December
--------

As the year YC108 approached its end, the news across the empires during
December remained resolutely grim, with war breaking out between two
Amarr Holders over the honor of one's daughter. The insulting behavior
of Touraj Miyan towards Mina Darabi, led the latter's father, Iraj
Darabi, to declare war between the two minor houses. This war became
mired in stalemate when the House Darabi fleet stymied the larger House
Miyan fleet using clever tactics.

The Caldari State saw further violence in its industrial sector, when
insurgent guerillas attacked a Kaalakiota factory on Sirppala II. While
there were no deaths, several security guards were injured and
production at the factory was severely disrupted. Commentators decided
that the attacks, and the worker strikes that followed, benefited
Kaalakiota's rival [Sukuuvestaa Corporation](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB)
more than anyone else and suggested the involvement of the latter in
orchestrating the unrest. Sukuuvestaa strongly denied this and indeed
Kaalakiota itself stated that it could see no evidence its rival had
been involved.

The year was rounded off by the Third Alliance Tournament, which was
dominated by high-firepower teams and many matches with total wipeouts
of the opposing side. A notable highlight of this tournament was the
spectacular loss of one of the few privately-owned Imperial Issue
Apocalypses by the Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate team. The final was
fought between challengers for the title The R0NIN and defending
champions Band of Brothers, with the latter triumphing once more and
remaining the only tournament winners to date.
