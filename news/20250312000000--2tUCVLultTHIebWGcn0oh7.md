### New Caldari Under Crisis
The Caldari State capital system of New Caldari is experiencing a Drifter Crisis. The State military is scrambling to respond as Drifter forces have begun attacking megacorporation infrastructure within the system. The Chief Executive Panel has put out a joint announcement calling for all Capsuleers loyal to the State to help fight off this new threat. The statement was delivered by Chairman Akimaka Saraki beside the Landfall monument. The Chairman refused to join his staff in a bunker beneath the city despite his security team's requests.

“Today our enemy comes to the heart of our State without care or caution. They believe that they are strong, and that we are no more than their playthings. They are wrong.

“They would see us suffer, but suffering is the fire that hardens our resolve. They would terrorize us, but we are without fear. They fight without honor, but it is our honor and our sense of duty that are our greatest strengths.

“To all who fly and would call themselves Caldari, now is the time to prove who we are. Let us send these cowards back through the wormhole they crawled out of. Then, we follow them, and teach them the true meaning of regret.”

### The Race Begins

Ten factions have begun researching new means of access Drifter wormholes with the help of capsuleers. Only five factions will be able to lay claim to a Drifter wormhole system. So far the Triglavians are leading the way by a landslide, with over 45% of all the progress made in these early hours of the competition.

### Analysis

The Triglavians have been in conflict with the Drifters since their first encounter. Some academics have even theorized that this is the latest leg of an even more ancient conflict. The Scope reached out to the Triglavian forces inside Pochven for comment on their advancement. All we received in return was this anonymous statement:

The struggle is all-time istina. Kybernauts seek glorification by surpassing followers of the poshlost. Dedication grants proving of direction in the flow. Advanced-time extirpation of the Ancient Enemy Azdajza approaches.

Of the four major factions, the Amarr Empire is leading so far in contributions, taking second place overall. The Amarr lost their previous Empress to a Drifter fleet. They have often held the lead in crisis completions and it is no surprise to see faithful capsuleers offering their Empire early support. Empress Catiz I called this “a righteous sign of our people's dedication. Once again we rise on every front to claim our rightful place among the stars.”

The Angel Cartel has made a surprisingly strong showing in these first hours, claiming third place so far. This shadowy criminal organization is believed to be primarily interested in access to Drifter tech and protecting its existing clandestine operations from disruption. The Angel Cartel is shrouded in secrets, and fired upon the Scopes shuttle when it approached them for comment.

Filling out the top-five are the Gallente and Caldari. These long-term rivals have both managed to beat out the Minmatar Republic in the early days of the competition. The Caldari have been one of the Crisis' top performers, while the Gallente initially failed to mount a strong opposition. Both must now summon greater support if they wish to secure their positions.

The Society of Conscious Thought is so far ranking a distant last of all participants, raising questions over how the public has perceived their recent activities. The Society came under scrutiny following accusations that they had attempted to infiltrate Thukker clans via education programs. The Society dismissed these claims as fabrications, but some question what the true motives of this ancient organization are.

The impact of the Harmonics recovered in Tabbetzur last week has yet to be measured in these results. Recipients are likely racing to decipher what they can from these items before the Deathless Circle is able to disable them. Market manipulators initially attempted to block intended recipients from receiving these items using buy orders disguised as legitimate interest, but factions were able to circumvent this problem using their LP stores to process the items instead. 

These results are only from the first few hours of the attempt, and with many days of research ahead of these factions, the prize is still anyone’s to claim.
