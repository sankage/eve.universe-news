 **Hakonen, Lonetrek** \- It is understood that Morsus Mihi [RAWR] will be undergoing a full standings reset, with the exception of keeping RAZOR Alliance blue.   
  
It is believed that RAWR will be moving to Delve and at the same time will be looking to remove many industrialist pilots in favour of combat focused ones.   
  
Imperian, RAWR alliance Operations Leader, confirmed the rumours, saying that although Razor alliance will be remaining blue "for old-times sake" and because "their pilots are awesome", they will not be joining them in Delve.   
  
Despite RAWR revealing that RAZOR Alliance will remain blue, RAZOR Alliance members seem reluctant to comment. That would suggest that perhaps a full standings reset from RAWR may indeed be long overdue.
