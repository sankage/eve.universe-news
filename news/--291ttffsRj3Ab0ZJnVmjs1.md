# Prisoner 47
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/prisoner-47

**Prisoner 47** is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) commoner imprisoned on a
secret [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) prison colony. In his time there
he has passed from desperation and exhaustion to enlightenment and
fearlessness.

Imprisonment
------------

The Prisoner had been captured by the Minmatar and tried in secret
military courts. He was deemed a threat to Minmatar freedom, so he was
transported to a secret prison on an unknown planet. The first day he
arrived, he witnessed a guard kill a new prisoner for no reason. He
suffered along with the rest of the prisoners in the guards' sadistic
games, though he did not hate the guards because he viewed them as a
force of nature rather than human. He did, however, come to hate certain
other prisoners - who he likened to ghosts - once he discovered they
were utterly indifferent to the guards' brutality and seemed to be
spared any repercussions of the games.

Rebellion
---------

His faith shaken by these ghosts, he began seeking answers. 47 brutally
attacked one of the chosen prisoners with a plate and, before he was
beaten by the guards, heard the man mention something about a
"king." After recuperating from the
beating, he assaulted more of the indifferent prisoners until one told
him the King was in the jungle. Though he did not know if the King was
even a person and had no directions, he fled into the jungle to seek
him.

Enlightenment
-------------

After several days of an increasingly difficult and ragged search, he at
last found the King, who turned out to be an Amarr hermit living in a
shack in the midst of a large, dangerous swamp.

The King fed him, explained how the prison got supplies, and revealed to
him that those who were given "faith" by the King were spared by the
guards. Prisoner 47, long since pushed past his breaking point, readily
agreed to embrace the chaos of the camp and become one of the prisoners
he had previously hated. As he left the King, he encountered a wild
[slaver hound](4nmSv26geCZDYdQ8E5cVh9), which growled at him but
otherwise left him unharmed. Rather than be frightened by it, he found
kinship with the beast.
