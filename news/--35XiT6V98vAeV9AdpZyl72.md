# The Broker
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-broker

Aeron Assis. Niques S. 'Leutre. Niemar Kokolen. Are any of
these names the real name of the man who uses them? His best known alias
is not even a name: **the Broker**. Mention the Broker to any
governmental agent anywhere within the world of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) and you'll be sure to get a
response. The only thing more numerous than the number of aliases he is
known by is the number of speculations on his background. There are
precious few concrete facts known about this elusive spy, negotiator,
informant, arms dealer and manipulator of men and states. As a master of
disguise, who utilizes the latest in cloning and DNA technology to keep
his appearance a secret, such basic details as race, height or
hair-color are unknown. However, he's most often considered to be of
either [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) or [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) ancestry, of average height and build,
with no apparent quirks or physical marks of notice.

For more than 50 years the Broker has directly or indirectly been
involved in various dealings between states, prominent warlords or
intelligence agencies. Most of these dealings include exchange of
information, weapon selling and espionage. In addition, various accounts
of criminal activity and even terrorism have sometimes been credited to
the Broker, but none of them are based on any solid facts. What is known
is that the Broker operates a vast information net, mainly within the
higher strata of the society. He uses this net to gain advantageous
business deals, but he also uses the information garnered to blackmail,
bribe or manipulate people or even whole governments. In these
operations he's often working under contract from a third party,
invariably a political or economical rival of the victims.

As befits the secretive and shadowy endeavors of the Broker, few of his
deeds have reached the public eye. In the inner circles of the espionage
world, everyone has a story of their own about him, often offering a
glimpse of a piece of much grander scheme the Broker has undertaken. One
of his more celebrated feats took place early in his career, almost half
a century ago and is known among intelligence agents as the [Omicron Incident](6DrNULs5fhn08ajtKLHiqc).
