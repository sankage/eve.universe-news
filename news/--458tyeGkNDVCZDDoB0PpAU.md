Responses to Emancipation
-------------------------

With [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) still absorbing the implications of
Empress [Jamyl I's](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) emancipation of all slaves
of 9th generation and upwards, New Year brought news of some holders in
outlying regions of the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) refusing to
comply with the Imperial decree on slave releases. While hundreds of
millions of slaves had been or were in the process of being released
following the [Empress's](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) proclamation,
holders controlling several million slaves in systems in the
[Aridia](uPYIH9Hhde0bYIaZFR4eB) and Genesis regions defied the edict and
demanded the [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) make a
ruling on the religious legality of the order. Some recalcitrant
[Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) also went so far as to appeal to the
[Speakers of Truth](3vA8Xh4A10DiybH2UTOEUO), in itself suggesting
that this was for them a direct dispute with Empress Jamyl I.

The hopes of the so-called 'Refusard' Holders were to be dashed when the
Theology Council swiftly condemned them and called on all Imperial
subjects to enforce the will of Empress Jamyl I. The Theology Council's
trenchant ruling reaffirmed the ancient doctrine that "the word of the
Empress is the word of God, the will of the Empress is the will of God"
and warned of harsh punishment for those continuing to refuse the edict.
Empire-wide transmission of the Council's ruling, and news that the
Speakers of Truth declined to intervene, led to a widespread collapse of
the Refusards with many immediately complying and repenting before
officials of the [Imperial Chancellor](7GOV3morIu47J3BmidrhU8).

However, several holders on several planets in the Aridia region, known
for its plethora of hardline cults and ultra-orthodox sects, maintained
their refusal to release slaves under the terms of the edict, citing
religious justification. Chancellor
[Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV) instructed a fleet seconded to
the Chancellery to enforce the edict using all means necessary. It is
known that the enforcement fleet subjected several Refusard holder
estates and associated targets to heavy bombardment from orbit, and
numerous locations were assaulted by Chancellery troops. In all, these
actions resulted in the seizure of over 15 million slaves who were
subsequently released in line with the emancipation proclamation.

The treatment of the most recalcitrant Refusards was harsh indeed, with
the leaders summarily executed and their followers and families reduced
to [slavery](slavery) for generations. Others who less
dramatically sought to evade the edict's terms were also firmly dealt
with as holders using subterfuge and fraud to keep their 9th generation
slaves were pursued by the [Ministry of Internal Order](5P4c9Lcr1rAUNd2Lb8gb3t). In a notable case, the
wealthy slaveholder Adash Korta, Holder of Dakba and owner of something
over half a million slaves, was found to have altered the genealogical
records of his stock, thereby hiding the 9th generation and above status
of approximately 100,000 slaves. The Theology Council made an example of
Korta, condemning him to slavery, stripping his family of noble rank and
distributing his assets between the new Holder of Dakba and other local
Holders.

Reactions to the emancipation edict across New Eden were somewhat mixed.
The [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) was muted in its reactions but
clearly many saw it as an opportunity to ease old tensions between the
Caldari, legally and culturally opposed to slavery, and the Amarr over
the issue. In the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) many
welcomed the release of hundreds of millions of slaves, although
concerns were expressed by some politicians that it could result in a
new influx of refugees to Gallente regions. The
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) diaspora in the Federation was more
sceptical as to the quality of Empress Jamyl I's mercy. This view found
more than an echo in the response from the Minmatar Republic, where
[Sanmatar](180IYq6xQy0PzfGH6hLEuO) [Maleatu Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV) warned of 'Amarr treachery' even as
he welcomed millions of slaves home to the Minmatar worlds.

Reaction to Executions
----------------------

Reactions to the
widely-publicized executions of the Gallente Admiral [Anvent Eturrer](4ft267N4XjELE5by1uHCt5) and former Amarr [Court Chamberlain](4cstqCKrXLAu5XDiqztSe6) [Dochuta
Karsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL) at the end of the last year
continued for some time. Most strident in their criticism of the very
public and grotesque method of cellular immolation used by the
Federation to put to death the traitor Eturrer were the Servant [Sisters of EVE](2eTQAT2DL0C7TWVtkOr8pN), calling it "barbaric and inhumane"
and urging the method be banned. The Federation government made no
official response to this but many Gallente citizens defended the public
execution and even the immolation method. Pro-war rallies saw many
thousands backing the Federation's approach, though other citizens
expressed quiet reservations. In contrast, reaction to the private,
almost dignified execution of Dochuta Karsoth were few. However, an
[Amarr Imperial Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g) observer's report of the
[Royal Khanid Navy](nQJFwBFQzGij9cZKKCrm7) operations against the
[Blood Raider](7obiU8rOyJkPZ3S0Faxc5W) Covenant that netted Karsoth
told of the heavy cost on both sides.

Economic Stimulus
-----------------

Early in January, in another bold initiative from the Amarr Empire,
Empress Jamyl I announced a multi-trillion ISK package of investment
into the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy). The Caldari-Amarr Economic
Stimulus Agreement (CAESA) was negotiated with the assistance of the
[Tash-Murkon Family](4t1KEOTA8LvYIHDcOtIPAb) and the Khanid
Kingdom but reactions within the Empire were
mixed. While the more liberal Tash-Murkon and Kor-Azor hailed the
investment package, religious conservatives and Amarr business leaders
expressed concern that such investment should more properly be aimed at
Amarr businesses. In the Caldari State reactions were almost entirely
favorable, with Executor [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG) welcoming
the package and pledging that the Amarr Empire would receive a
profitable return on the investment. In a development related to the
emancipation, the Caldari Providence
Directorate announced it
would be making available a number of experienced trainers for
secondment within the Amarr Empire to train former slaves who choose to
take up residence there.

Militia Warfare Increases
-------------------------

Other developments across New Eden as the year began included increased
levels of fighting between the militias in the war zone even as the [Caldari Navy's](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) logistics command published a report
detailing the costs of occupying [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i). The scale of the costs both in ISK,
materiel and morale among occupying troops came as a surprise to some
and the liberal faction megacorporation
[Hyasyoda](WisddAsk7hie3SUcwiNwa) used the occasion of a
debate on the report in the [Chief Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr) to criticize the military
policies of State Executor Tibus Heth. While this criticism elicited
some support, the patriot bloc corporations, in particular [Lai Dai](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT), supported Heth's policies
vigorously. Perhaps more ominous for Heth than the almost expected
criticism from the liberals was the silence of the practical faction
corporations. Certainly, the grim tally set out in the report had
clearly caused disquiet among the profit-conscious Caldari megacorps.

Competition for Ishukone Succession
-----------------------------------

 Another
significant development in the Caldari State concerned the [Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI), without a CEO since the
Malkalen Disaster in May [YC110](4s7KrRaqQANTatQhzlSaRi), and the
megacorporation's long search for a new chief executive. With several
candidates having fallen by the wayside the previous year, it emerged
that the Ishukone board was seriously considering two leading
contenders: Mens Reppola, CEO of [Ishukone Watch](21GQBhNgawJQQ39wqVX4yU) and a friend of the late [Otro Gariushi](5QydCJCoYvbvbWvFlAlbHg), and Soisonen Okalala, CEO of
Ishukone mining subsidiary [Minedrill](2cjgnHBuWiKY7pH2xjzvG0). With both
candidates being chief executives within the Ishukone family of
corporations and appealing to different tendencies within the Ishukone
board, the competition between the two was expected to be close.

Traditions and 6th Tournament
-----------------------------

In the Minmatar Republic, an upsurge of interest in the history of the
Minmatar and its tribes was most interestingly manifested in a great
increase in enthusiasm for the traditional cuisine of the Minmatar
peoples. The Minmatar [Native Freshfood](kxxhlMqv4IIzQkSf083E2)
corporation reported a rise in sales of traditional ingredients and
recipe books, attributing it to the cost-effectiveness of traditional
cuisine as well as the attraction of eating "like Minmatar."

The Independent Gaming Commission announced its 6th Alliance Tournament
for [capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) would begin at the end of the
month. In a move that was perhaps designed to play on patriotic feelings
in the core empires, and thereby increase viewing figures, the IGC
announced that teams from the four militias would be accepted into the
qualifying rounds of the tournament. In the event, none of the militia
teams progressed past the qualifiers into the final rounds, perhaps
unable to score sufficiently against seasoned and well-equipped
capsuleer alliance squads despite some individual wins.
