 **New Eden** \- DevilDogUSMC has [completed his second circumnavigation of New Eden](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/radar/follow/0gpHUVtjJPc79A1X) in less than 12 hours.  
  
The venture saw him manually navigate through 25 regions, including Delve, Fountain and Cache, and make a total of 435 system jumps, beginning in Fluekele, Sinq Laison and finishing in 4C-B7X, Outer Ring.  
  
DevilDogUSMC had hoped that his second circumnavigation would attract more capsuleers, and afterward he claimed he was satisfied with how it went: "I had a greater positive reaction in 0.0 than I thought I would ever get. From all regions."  
  
It didn't completely go without the odd scare, as DevilDogUSMC revealed: "In J9SH-A, I had a group of assault frigates and battlecruisers try to ram me off the gate right before I was jumping."  
  
On future ventures, he had this to say: "I would do it again but for now I have to rest. I plan on helping young corperations learn to manually navigate and to use tactics to help stay alive in unsecure space."  
  
The circumnavigation was completed in a Proteus, named Iza Fire. He has decided to keep the ship, as it "means way too much" to him.
