**Yulai** \- Sansha's Nation continues to assault settlements of all four empires, with the total number of abductions rising into the millions. The sudden intensity and frequency of the attacks has fueled rampant theories about their motives and the nature of their resurgence. Most distressing to some is the possible revival of Sansha Kuvakei.

The founder of the Nation, Kuvakei has long been assumed dead, killed during the invasion by a coalition of the empires under the then-nascent CONCORD. While his corpse was never discovered, the likelihood of his survival was considered "near zero."

However, the appearance of a man identifying himself as "Master Kuvakei" on the Intergalactic Summit has whipped up a frenzy of speculation. The speaker, while not directly using the name Sansha Kuvakei, appears similar to historical images of Sansha and refers to the Nation as "my Nation" in his brief, two-line statement. Additionally, many of the attacking Sansha pilots have spoken of their Master Kuvakei in the present tense. Some experts remain skeptical, however, that it could truly be Sansha Kuvakei.

Aralin Jick, an expert on the Nation with the Ministry of Internal Order, believes it is all a smokescreen. "The Nation uses command interfaces to control their True Slaves, who are programmed to follow the orders of Sansha Kuvakei," he explained. "The True Slaves may believe they are receiving orders from Sansha, but in reality it's little more than some taskmaster doing an impersonation. "

Despite Jick's skepticism, many citizens across New Eden are concerned. A CONCORD official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, believes Master Kuvakei is the actual Sansha. "Anyone saying it's not Sansha is deluding themselves. I know many people say it's impossible he could have survived this long, but it's not unheard of in this day and age."
