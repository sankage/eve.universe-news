OURSULAERT 1002 - Security forces and medical first responders aboard the Federation Navy Testing Facilities in orbit around Oursulaert III have responded to reports of a deadly stampede in the commercial docking bays.

Eyewitness reports indicate that the panic was sparked by the news of communications failures in the Seyllin system. Passengers waiting in the commercial transportation terminal attempted to storm a waiting vessel in order to secure passage out of the system. A report from the transportation provider indicates that the vessel is currently locked down and secure, a significant number of passengers have been injured during the stampede, and the mob is currently refusing to peacefully disperse back into the terminal.
