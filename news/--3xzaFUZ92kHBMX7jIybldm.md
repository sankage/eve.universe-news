# Ametat and Avetat
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/ametat-and-avetat

The **Ametat and Avetat** (Ancient [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) for the Scepter and the Crown) are a pair of holy Amarr artifacts linked to the
semi-mythological first [Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ),
[Amash-Akura](4tm7IOIn0xaGeNFQcRl0Lc), the founding of the Empire, and
the mythological beings known as the [sefrim](2Zrqfwd6S0boZhGwbPzSnq). They
are mentioned numerous times in the [Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp)
and are attributed with several magical powers. Despite their
mythological status, numerous scholars propose that the artifacts
actually existed at one time.

Story
---------

During the tenth year of the reign of Emperor Amash-Akura, the sun went
black. Birds fell dead from the sky, plants withered, and people fell
sick in droves. Despite the ill omens, from the sky came the entities
known as the sefrim. Described as beautiful, angelic beings who had to
wear masks to protect others from being struck dead at their sight, the
sefrim had been ordered by God to guard the Emperor and give to him the
Ametat and Avetat. The Ametat (the Scepter) gave Amash-Akura vigor and
kept him from aging. The Avetat (the Crown) provided him with wisdom and
acumen, allowing him to rule wisely and justly.

When [Molok the Deceiver](2RdbRSnuNB033jTKtf12fV) later turned
the people against Amash-Akura, the Emperor angrily cast out the sefrim.
Immediately, the sun once again went black, the Ametat and Avetat lost
their power and Amash-Akura immediately withered and aged greatly.

Despite this, Amash-Akura fought against his enemies using the Ametat
and Avetat. Soon after defeating them, the Emperor passed away in his
bedchambers and the night sky turned red. The Ametat and Avetat were
kept in the Emperor's family for four centuries, when they inexplicably
disappeared. According to a report from the [Court Chamberlain](4cstqCKrXLAu5XDiqztSe6), they had not shown any sign
of tarnish or age.

Historical Evidence
-----------------------

There has been much debate on if the Ametat and Avetat existed and
whether they possessed the amazing powers ascribed to them. The
most-commonly held belief among non-Amarr scholars is that the Ametat
and Avetat were simply crown jewels bestowed to the first Amarr Emperor
by his vassals. According to these scholars, the jewels were given
mythological qualities as a form of propaganda by early Emperors in
order to reinforce their power and inspire worship from the commoners.

Amarr theologians, however, have presented numerous pieces of evidence
to counter these claims. First is the the darkening of the sun recorded
in the Book of Epitoth, which matches up with two solar eclipses caused
by the planet [Zorast](1PoS7ZiZUXSHjf81r7jkmq). Second, an asteroid strike on
Zorast occurred roughly at the time when Amash-Akura is recorded as
passing, which would have caused an astronomical event visible on Amarr.

Finally, they point to the discovery of numerous scattered artifacts
across the cosmos that have supposedly inexplicable powers. While many
have proven to be [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) artifacts, or bits of
technology belonging to the Sleepers or other lost civilizations, some,
such as [Jamyl I's](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) super weapon, remain
unexplained. The Amarr contend the Ametat and Avetat could be similar
relics given to the Emperor by the sefrim.

Searches and Hoaxes
-------------------

Since the legend of the Ametat and Avetat plays such a pivotal role in
the founding and early glory of the Amarr Empire, numerous attempts to
locate them have been made. While the entirety of Amarr Prime has been
scoured for them, the vastness of space means that they may still exist
on some forlorn planet, awaiting rediscovery.

All searches so far have ended in failure. Two such searches are
particularly notable, however.

### Ilash Toth's expedition

The first was launched shortly after the Empire developed the jump gate,
when a notable radical theologian, [Ilash Toth](EjtSjC49javQdA6h7gXyR),
and a contingent of fifty-thousand followers set up an expedition to
find the artifacts. Toth had long espoused a return to the early days of
the Empire, before contact with the [Udorians](723tMHRDvyldo15RMLMuqh)
instigated the [Reclaiming](70QLNGRwCwHUgmcjTmuhsA), and purportedly
received a vision from God that would lead him to the Ametat and Avetat
and enable him to reestablish what he considered the old days of glory.

Toth's following had grown quite massive and his intention to launch an
expedition drew great interest from all quarters of the Empire. The
search lasted for three years, with Toth reportedly growing closer and
closer to uncovering the resting place of the artifacts. Eventually he
came to believe he was nearly at the point of discovery and sent a tenth
of his followers back to Amarr to spread the word that the Ametat and
Avetat were on their way back to the Empire.

However, Toth and his remaining followers never returned, and no trace
of them was found. The system where those followers that had returned
claimed they had left him was devoid of any indication of their fates,
with no wrecks nor evidence that Toth had ever been to the system.
Treasure hunters fell upon the system, but never discovered the Ametat
and Avetat. To this day, Toth's disappearance remains a mystery.

### Harr Indi's expedition

Shortly after the conquest of the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)
Empire, a [Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) claimed to have found the Ametat
and Avetat resting in the jungles of [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6). The
Holder, [Harr Indi](5LmhGucAuERwcspjHN8W52), said that he'd overheard
tribal stories being told by his slaves and, rather than punish them for
telling blasphemous legends, realized what they described resembled the
lost artifacts.

Indi interrogated his slaves and followed their information to a ruined
temple deep in the jungle. The temple was covered in Amarr iconography
and contained numerous artifacts, among them the Ametat and Avetat.

Indi delivered the artifacts to the Emperor in a glorious ceremony,
receiving a massive reward for his discovery. For nearly a year, the
artifacts were accepted as authentic by the people. However, eventually
the [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) determined they were
exquisite forgeries. It was only by chance this was discovered, thanks
to a stray rune on the Ametat containing an extra stroke that did not
match ancient drawings of the artifacts.

Indi disappeared, but a search of his estates revealed he had fabricated
everything. There'd been no tribal stories, no ruined temple, and the
false Ametat and Avetat were the result of nearly a decade of work, with
Indi's motive having apparently been nothing more than a desire for
fame. Imperial authorities never caught him, suggesting someone may
tipped him off that the forgery had been discovered.
