Yulai - After a frantic search of the Yulai system following the sudden and devastating assault from the combined Minmatar-Thukker fleet, multiple evacuation shuttles have been secured by search and rescue teams that are now scouring the area looking for survivors. It has been disclosed that a special recovery squadron was earlier dispatched to protect the evacuated delegates from the empires who were currently in residence in the CONCORD station.

The emergency evacuation shuttles' distress beacons were picked up in the aftermath of the attack by the squadron, who have begun to rally the delegations and escort them to safety. The majority of the diplomats have been accounted for, although several others and many members of the diplomatic staff remain unaccounted for.
