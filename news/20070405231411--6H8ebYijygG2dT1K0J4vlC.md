Last Sunday evening the Amarrian Speaker of Truths, Brother Joshua, was attacked by the Holland Reclamation and Salvage corporation en route to the Ordion system. Thanks to a capsuleer escort, however, he was able to proceed on his journey unharmed. 

Last week, Brother Joshua publicly announced his intention to travel through the Kor-Azor region in order to investigate “allegations of misconduct” on the behalf of Aritcio Kor-Azor, after getting permission from the Theology Council to conduct such an inquiry. 

Brother Joshua set out to visit the systems between Kulu and Ordion, where he intended to visit several Holders and discuss with them the region’s situation and future. At the start of his journey the Praetorians Imperialis Excubitoris and Ordo Quaesitoris joined him in order to escort him to his destination. 

Around 18:45 New Eden standard time, the Holland Reclamation and Salvage laid ambush and attacked Brother Joshua, but their attack was unsuccessful thanks to the loyalist forces, commanded by Rodj Blake.
