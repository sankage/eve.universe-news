**Tribute Region, 20:30** -  Initial reports from E-OGL4 indicate that Northern Coalition forces have successfully destroyed an Avatar class Titan piloted by Shrike of the Band of Brothers Alliance.

Information is scarce as the battle is still underway in E-OGL4. Reports from the field suggest additional super-capital losses from Band of Brothers, but as of yet these are unconfirmed reports only.

More information will be posted as it becomes available.
