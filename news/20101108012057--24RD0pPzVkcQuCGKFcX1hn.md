Etherium Reach recently topped the list of the most violent systems in New Eden as conflict between the Northern Coalition and opposing forces continues to escalate.  
  
Over the past twenty four hours, there have been over two thousand ship destructions and over one thousand capsuleeer pods destroyed in the region.  
  
Statistics are showing that activity within Etherium Reach is at least double that of Feythabolis, ranked the second most violent system, with over eight hundred ship losses and five hundred capsuleer pod losses.  
  
Shadow of xXDEATHXx have taken substantial losses in sovereignty in the month of October, losing thirteen systems within Etherium Reach.  
  
As conflict continues in the region, stability of Etherium Reach appears to be a considerable distance away.
