# Special Affairs for Regulations and Order
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/special-affairs-for-regulations-and-order

The **Special Affairs for Regulations and Order** (SARO) unit is a
special forces group within the [Directive Enforcement Department](1xZoOUsqaDhJw7gQffHMFC) (DED) . The SARO group is
one of the toughest police units in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) and is notorious for its brutal yet
efficient methods.

SARO is mainly used for hostage situations, assaults on heavily-armed
pirate havens, dealing with large-scale criminal activity and similar
tasks where force is more useful than finesse.

A Special Affairs for Regulations and Order (SARO) ship was destroyed by
the terrorist Aki Onikori (AKA "Fiend") some
time around YC103. This was an embarrassing incident for SARO and, as a
result, the Fiend is one of SARO's most wanted criminals.
