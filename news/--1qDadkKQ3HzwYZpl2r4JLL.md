# Dochuta Karsoth
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/dochuta-karsoth

Dochuta Karsoth, an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo), was the former
Court Chamberlain during the reign of
[Emperors](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV) and [Doriam II](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT). He
continued to serve as Court Chamberlain following the death of Doriam II
and served as the interim ruler of the Empire during the years until
[Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) ascended to the throne.

Rise to power
-------------

Karsoth's rise to power as Court Chamberlain is currently unchronicled,
though it was likely due to a mix of his personal influence, cunning,
political manipulation, and connections.

Following the assassination of Doriam II, Karsoth served as acting
regent, and pledged to hunt down the assassin. Despite this, when it was
revealed that [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) knew the identities of the
attackers, Karsoth remained quiet. Additionally, he refused to confirm a
leaked CONCORD memo naming a member of the Royal Khanid
Navy as being responsible. He drew heavy
criticism for allowing non-Amarr to investigate the matter.

Tumultuous rule
---------------

### Corruption in the court

The position of Court Chamberlain elicited a great change in his
demeanor. By the time he ran the Empire in absentia of the Emperor, he
was a fat, vile manipulator - so obese he needed cybernetic legs to
support his frame - with little regard for the Amarr religion, and was
known to engage in sexual orgies that occasionally included underage
participants. He was described as being an atheist at heart, cultivating
a dark network of spies and informants, and reportedly cavorting with
the Blood Raiders. He certainly introduced
[Antar](1Hsjz0jFxyOlxJm9FhkcLv) to them in memorable fashion, and sent the man
to them as his own emissary.

### Capsuleer Cooperation

Karsoth ordered the CVA alliance to retrieve the stolen [Cross of the Sacred Throne Order](3PkiBQG9h14kCrM9qRrInk).

### The Bleak Lands attack

Following the attacks on The Bleak Lands
by the [Defiants](6aq75j8f7bMZckaqXWXSC6), Karsoth's command of the
Imperial Navy was called into question. Reports
claimed that the Navy mostly ignored his commands. In response to the
attacks, Karsoth put pressure on the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) to act against the Defiants. He later
detained [Admiral Saracen](5yh6X5XInEkD9aWQnXPF5X) and accused him
of high treason for actions inside the Bleak Lands.

### Challenges to Karsoth's authority

When [Uriam Kador](7LJKelrqDXAAUYi6o48Uno) made a public statement about
the lack of momentum in electing a new Emperor, some took it as a
challenge to Karsoth's regency.

Following numerous clashes with Karsoth, several justices of the
Theology Council went missing. After
several days of anticipation, Karsoth released a statement claiming the
missing justices had attempted to have him assassinated. During the
speech, he laid blame on the slow progress of the [Succession Trials](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx) on the
[Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh), implying they did not wish to undergo
the [Shathol'Syn](7uCmeRGL3bgVWlEWQ9TZQb). Reaction across the cluster
was mixed, with Amarr predictably showing the most relief at its
failure, [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) offering support, and
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and Minmatar mixed between relief that
the Empire was not destabilized into igniting war and disappointed that
what they viewed as the leader of a corrupt government was not slain.

### Suspect benevolence

Though some blamed Karsoth for the hold up in selecting a new Emperor,
others praised his leadership in the absence of an Emperor. The
Chamberlain continued the goodwill programs toward the Minmatar enacted
by Doriam II prior to his death.

When news surfaced that a large population of
[Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) slaves was found in the [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz), Karsoth pledged to help preserve
them. His actual intentions were to have them exterminated, although
ultimately he was unable to see this through.

Fall from power and subsequent death
------------------------------------

### Capture

Following the invasion of Amarr space by the [Elder Fleet](7JAFwYwGqzvPv7yLIDlfjp), Karsoth disappeared, using the confusion
to flee to the Blood Raiders. Once the dust had settled, Karsoth had
already been stamped as one of the greatest traitors in the history of
the Amarr Empire, and a massive hunt for him was undertaken. In late
December YC110, the [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj) launched several assaults on Blood
Raider holdings with the intention of capturing Karsoth. They succeeded,
and Karsoth was transported to the Empire in a small vessel on which he
was the only passenger.

His rule and subsequent flight and capture in late YC110 had left him
in bad physical shape: Not only had he become too obese to stand under
his own power, requiring assistance from several guards, but he was
coughing and wheezing, and his body was covered in cuts and bruises. The
Amarr people had him tortured quietly in private, eager to move on and
forget the corruption of his rule. Empress Jamyl I then met him before
his execution for a final interview.

### Final interview with Jamyl

During their talk, Jamyl asked Karsoth if he had made peace with God; he
nodded. She then read a list of his crimes: allying with the Blood
Raiders, ruling through lies and terror, failing to halt the Minmatar
invasion, corrupting the innocent, betraying the loyal, and turning the
Empire into an orgy of corruption and hedonism. She acknowledged that he
had brought commerce to the Empire, but maintained it had been blackened
by ties to the underworld.

Jamyl I continued by stating he deserved more than death for his crimes,
but the Empire could not be bothered to do it. Karsoth expressed his
disgust with her and the Empire, saying in its quest for salvation in
Heaven it had forgotten how to live in the mortal world. However, when
Jamyl I gently stroked his cheek and stated that he feared her, he was
stricken with terror. He wondered out loud if she hated him, but she
said he was not worthy of it. He was allowed a chance to speak his case,
but refrained, and was then led off to be quietly executed.
