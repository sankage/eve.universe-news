# Sanada
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/sanada

**Sanada** was a religious leader whose apocalyptic
[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) sect was eventually considered too extreme by
Amarr church authorities and excommunicated. She had been preaching on
space stations and continued the practice with her small but devout
group of followers, one of whom was [Auduban](C9YpzTe4NgePFlVHHzmK9).

After being run off several stations and seeing her group of followers,
cadre of ships and stocks of supplies all dwindle away, Sanada's
desperation grew, to the point where she confided in Auduban that she
was at the point of giving up completely. Auduban, an acolyte whose
devotion to Sanada was unwavering and fanatical, attempted to fix their
problems by installing rigs in their single remaining vessel in the hope
of fitting it for combat.

He failed, miserably, and Sanada ended her physical life in the ensuing
onboard ship systems failures, though her physical remains - and,
possibly, spirit - remained of some import to the crazed Auduban and the
scheme he eventually concocted.
