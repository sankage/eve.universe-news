Last Sunday evening saw the successful delivery of another shipment of Gallente Drinks Incorporated’s lucrative supply contract.   
  
The third delivery out of four was transported to GDI’s headquarters in the Yulai solar system by “A GOD” and “Brecher”; the capsuleer pilots who had won the supply contract.   
  
As their contract nears its end with the final supply run scheduled to take place in the near future, the two pilots are reported to be very eager to complete their indenture to Gallente Drinks Inc, speculating at the reward promised to them for delivering the shipments on time.   
  
At this time, Gallente Drinks Inc CEO – Jetson Bills is remaining silent as to what award the capsuleers may receive for their diligent work.
