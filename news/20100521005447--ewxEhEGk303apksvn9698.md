 **Kourmonen, The Bleak Lands** \- On 112.05.14, the Kourmonen solar system was conquered by Amarr forces. The capture marked the conclusion of a two month campaign that saw the Minmatar Militia being ousted from the nine solar systems in Devoid and Bleak Lands they had previously conquered.  
  
According to Det Resprox, Amarr Militia forces had already begun reclaiming systems when the defection of Eran Mintor, a former Minmatar Fleet Commander, gave the Amarrians even more momentum: "he was responsible for the fleets capturing Ezzara and Arzad... and took a visit to Arzad to see the Starkmanir. What he saw there I do not know, but on his return he defected."  
  
Gangleri of 1st Praetorian Guards gives credit to the system recaptures to several Amarr corporations including Amarrian Retribution, Knighthood of the Merciful Crown, Fremens Space Tribe, PIE Inc, Absinthe Brothers and Deus Imperious.
