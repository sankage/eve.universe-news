Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/datapad

The **datapad** (or **holopad**) is the standard all-in-one device for managing communications, finances, and personal computing.

Commerce
--------

Daily consumer transactions between two entities take place by bringing
two of the devices close to each other and specifying the amount.
Datapads have the ability to be used for signing contracts and taking
tests.

Communications
--------------

The datapad is capable of interfacing with the standardized
communication protocol of the era and using any local network to send
and receive information. All datapad devices are capable of
communicating with each other on this network.

Security
--------

Datapads are [bioencrypted](6Tw4Dg0SbZ33nPCE9SSI7c). As such, they can
be used to establish contracts between individuals using a recognized
identification method, such as thumbprints combined with the use of an
"IDImplant." The datapad itself may be transferred or disposed of
without affecting the validity of the contract. Datapads can be used as
passes to areas on a station, such as the docks.

Other functions
---------------

Datapads have various functions that include video and image viewing,
and programmability to emit sounds and buzzes (as a form of alarm
clock).

Known special editions
----------------------

A holopad was given by [Cherall](1rzSTLqlstsXunsk1zG2mB) to
[Fimiris](1iEPH2s3XjS9V6yo2Nh06i). This pad was thin, contained his likeness
and could be animated to show Cherall's Dr. Adad character juggling. He
was also able to sign it.
