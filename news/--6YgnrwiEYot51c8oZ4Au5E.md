# Dialysis Machine
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/dialysis-machine

A form of **dialysis machine** exists that can vacuum up blood from a bleeding wound and inject it back into the body. This came in extremely handy during the punishment of [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV) by the [Speakers of Truth](3vA8Xh4A10DiybH2UTOEUO), when Aritcio couldn't be allowed to expire.
