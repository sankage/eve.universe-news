Yulai - *****This is a breaking news story***** Scope News has confirmed that CONCORD Bureau Station has been surrounded by a fleet composed entirely of Minmatar-designed warships, including at least a dozen Naglfar-class dreadnoughts with Republic Fleet markings. More surprisingly, the escorts of these capital ships are reported to be Thukker Tribe vessels. However, none of the ships are registered with NEOCOM broadcast tags, and all attempts to communicate with the intruders have failed. CONCORD and DED warships are locked in a standoff with the armada, but no shots have been fired. Reporters from the Scope News network are on scene and will continue to provide coverage of these events as they unfold.
