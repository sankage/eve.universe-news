The first CSM X Summit is now in full swing, with the second day of sessions between the EVE Online Development Team and the Council of Stellar Management occuring yesterday.

After a good 8 hours of talks, and while there are a couple of sessions which have to remain under NDA, we are happy to present the minutes for the second day, for your reading pleasure.
