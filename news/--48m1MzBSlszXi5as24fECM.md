# Ship Technology
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/ship-technology

**Ship technology** includes some of the most amazing scientific breakthroughs of modern times, which is no small matter considering what else has been invented in the world of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).

General
-------

-   [Capsules](capsule) are the core of modern [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) technology.
-   [Rigs](rigs) are a multipurpose technology designed to push ships beyond their initial designs.

Types and Designs
-----------------

There are multiple types of vessels, ranging from lowly shuttles to small frigates, all the way through bulky industrials slowly roaming through space, up to large fighting vessels such as battlecrusers, battleships and the almighty titans. Each of them has their own specific design, purpose and use.

-   [Frigates](6FJmBYuBTwDdtiiH8kIHsA) are small and cheap, on the interstellar scale, at least.
-   [Interceptors](5tDUsKRPyntVMgukOtqMaY) are a special frigate class intended for fast pursuit and tackling.
-   [Assault Frigates](1KYMoqBHSO5kh9oW5YTRWS) are designed around firepower and survivability.
-   [Electronic Attack Ships](30ATTxuqHH2UjqvSqb3JGc) are fast and agile frigates that focus on electronic warfare.
-   [Destroyers](1ZGRFdhUUSkZE3cebI0Air) aim to destroy things, hopefully smaller frigates, but not so much larger cruisers.
-   [Cruisers](3wE5sDRggwgYjiExdCRyL0) are mid-sized ships that fill a variety of specialized roles.
-   [Industrials](oPGFihhst5FK2rjcaxUsx) are our interstellar haulers.
-   The [Iteron](6fG7HxreLY12wHaw6hOY9G)-class cargo transport is cheap, fast, reliable and adaptable
-   The [Iteron Mark IV - Quafe Ultra Edition](5bqDU1ifvbhSQM1VjGyhLU) is a special, caffeine-fuelled version.
-   [Battlecruisers](battlecruisers) fill the size and firepower gap between cruisers and battleships.
-   [Battleships](vEsIuJJVnWWgEJ5JKZif7) are the largest sub-capital ships in New Eden.
-   [Marauders](4BTaZWhSPDignZcoVUIR3w) are a subclass designed for long-term stays in hostile environments without logistics support.
-   [CD-1](4vbefypiPcUrQTXwD6UTlv) is a specialized battleship.
-   A modified [Isogen-5 Abaddon](YOZhANdRLftwFSfeEMzG3) was glimpsed ferrying destructive cargo.
 -   The [Dam-Imud](1RiKpOIhjCFnO7WFCGbRsq) was an Apocalypse-class battleship.
-   [Titans](XH5ZPvSBGGIStAEWqWHOl) are as much mobile [space stations](space-stations) as ships.
-   The [Jovian Mothership](6XzKsKxV7dwE9QAm5cLNVQ) was a terrifying vessel that dictated the outcome of one of New Eden's  most notorious battles.
-   [Orbital bombers](2DkDo7hofFa5A9hWWPmXEc) were used in the Gallente-Caldari War.
-   [Project Skymother](56jHURaqYy9SzmHignb3Wz) was a historical development in starship engineering.
-   [Single-man fighters](2zJdxBu7hlAbyrhkl5sLou) were the Caldari answer to Gallente bombers.
-   [Mining barges](mining-barge) can tear through asteroids in a short time.

Propulsion and Travel
---------------------

Ships are able not only to drift through space - a grand feat in the history of any civilization - but withstand and maintain immense speeds, camera drones in tow, that may at times appear to violate some of the most fundamental laws of physics. They may rush down warp tunnels, disappear through wormholes, and be shunted through stargates.

-   [Fractal acceleration shell capacitors](1KeIiC16V0gDygL6JYhA0E) are a part of starship engines.
-   [Ship sensors](3DZ5KHi9SjRTCfJHAXvO4n) are a necessity for travelling through dark space.
-   [Stargates](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) render interstellar travel possible for ships lacking jumpdrives.
-   [Warp drives](7o1BhmhKqoA32WfmkW8Yqt) allow for speedy travel within the limits of a solar system.
-   A [warp tunnel](1N9cUs5FItibjtzKy50sol) is a visual phenomenon coincidental of warp drive operation.
-   The [micro jump drive](micro-jump-drive) was to be a major advancement in instantaneous travel, right up until the point where it instantaneously put someone in a place they very much shouldn't have been.

Combat
------

Those magnificent vessels, created through amazing feats of science and engineering, may drift through the skies, shunt between impossible distances and assist in the transport of innumerable people and objects. This being [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), mind, they're probably going to spend most of their time firing at one another. This may involve defensive combat - boosting, tanking and remote boosting - indirect combat - drones, ECMs, smartbombs - or simply direct, unequivocal combat, in the form of guns and missiles. It also includes how they detect friends and foes.

-   An [ancillary shield booster](ancillary-shield-booster) is vital for those occasions where you're caught with your shield down.
-   [Military drones](5TesdXq5to62CrbIBuPXxS) see great use, particularly among the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK).
-   The [Vampire](27nbX6dou9OiDPjbGAcm05) was an exceedingly dangerous - and costly - prototype combat drone.
-   The [Target Spectrum Breaker](target-spectrum-breaker) can cancel targeting locks against the ship they are fitted to.

Mining and Other Ancillary Functions
------------------------------------

Ships aren't just vessels for mining and hauling. They may engage in covert ops, for any number of purposes, or loot the wreckage of those unfortunates who found themselves in the way.

-   The [drone damage amplifier](drone-damage-amplifier) improves the damage output of combat drones.
-   [Salvage drones](4f8tIhuLBPHJsyPiIW8iwu) come in handy after a firefight.
-   [Salvage modules](salvage-modules) can be used for cargo retrieval.
-   [Warp scramblers](4uAflvhPRUB2142ZCg8hmw) keep target ships from escaping.

Internal Functions
------------------

Capsuleers control some aspects of ship operations, and can even push their vessels into overdrive when necessity calls.

Beyond that, though, operation of space vessels is a complex and tricky endeavor that requires the combined efforts of often large groups of experienced people.

So ships have crews, and some concessions need to be made to their comfort and well-being onboard their respective vessels. Those crews are thankfully not lost when the ships are - well, not all of them, at least - and thus can build up the experience needed to run the various internal systems that are either unreachable by or beyond the interest of capsuleers to focus on.

-   [Fedos](5vXRRw5WFv0cu5OUhLKBtE) are used on many ships, mainly [Minmatar](3VbZNIqcUMjhZ8dlSFN8f1), as a cheap organic waste disposal and cleaning system. Ships that employ fedos usually have a special nursery where female fedos are kept in a controlled environment to breed due to the very short life cycle of a fedo.
-   A [ship crew](3XUeMME0mskbriwkDeYNHs) is necessary, believe it or not, for the successful flight of most interstellar vessels.
-   [Viewing halls](TW9QsmXwueb9TjXxIPyHz) are omnipresent on ships.
