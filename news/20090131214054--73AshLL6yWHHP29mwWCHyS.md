We saw a Golem, a couple of Nightmare battleships, some Phantasm cruisers and in the last fight of the day Cry Havoc. fielded four Paladins.

With many eyes on the battlefield reports of Day 3 Qualifying, Day 4 should prove interesting as teams review fleet setups and try to outwit their rivals tomorrow.

Some of the losers of today's matches still have a chance to make it to the finals depending on the results of the next set of Qualifying matches tomorrow.
