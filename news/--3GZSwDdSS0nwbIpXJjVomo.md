Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/achuran-songbird

The **Achuran Songbird** is a small game bird that, while of [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) origin, is used in some
[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) cuisine to complement the [Amarr Rockjaw](1AytIEkcFkxiuyntgIm127).

A particular variant called the White Song is a past symbol of the [Achura's](4zhtMkBDe0W8xX2ihsfnik) Imperial line. Only government buildings were allowed to keep White Songs in captivity, and it was said that when the last White Song left the Royal Tower, the Achura Empire would die. The Achura Empire died first, but the White Song is still regarded with great reverence among the Caldari.
