Earlier today the Minmatar Mining Corporation held their first stage of a new marketing strategy to increase their mineral stocks.   
  
The Corporation is holding a lottery where by five winners will win a Rupture Class Cruiser. Each unit of unprocessed ore is counted as a ticket. Participants must only use Frigate or Cruiser class vessels to even out the competition. Ninmelan Ungur stated that they will be running this lottery until such times as internal quotas are filled.   
  
Concerned with the wellbeing of their members and participants of this lottery they have informed local security forces of this event. Extra security will be provided by the Minmatar Mining Corporation in case of disruption to the lottery.
