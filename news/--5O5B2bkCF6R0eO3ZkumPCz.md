# Holy Star
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/holy-star

The **Holy Star** is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) torture device. It is
made of a transparent, glass-like material, is roughly the size of an
adult man, and looks like a five-armed starfish. The device, like the
[Sin Eater](794wlFxb2YGdWeorXlrw9P), is a favorite of Amarr torturer
priest [Vitor Dranera](3KDpilEZ7Q2EdkIumRKMus), who employs it in what
he thinks of as his pest control problem.

Usage
-----

It is covered in highly reflective barbs. When not powered, the barbs do
no harm. When activated, the device slowly sucks away the body of
anything attached. It appears to start with blood, then moves onto the
hair and feathers, before finishing with flesh and bone. Once complete,
the victim has been sucked away into nothing.
