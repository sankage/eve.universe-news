[Test Alliance Please Ignore](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Test_Alliance_Please_Ignore) [TEST] engaged and destroyed a Revenant-class supercarrier belonging to pilot Damien Shroud of [Project.Mayhem.](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Project.Mayhem.) [16-13] on May 22, YC 118 in the [Erila system](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/The_Citadel/Erila) on the edge of Caldari space.

This marks only the [sixth](https://zkillboard.com/ship/3514/losses/) capsuleer-piloted Revenant destroyed in New Eden since the resurgence of Sansha's Nation. TEST joins [Black Legion.](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/99001861), [Pandemic Legion](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Pandemic_Legion), [Goonswarm](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Goonswarm_Federation) and [Snuffed Out](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Snuffed_Out) in the list of alliances who have successfully destroyed one of these elusive vessels.

In a communication passed to Interstellar Correspondents, Damien Shroud said that he   jumped his Revenant to kill a TEST Naglfar and commented that he wasn't afraid to "drop shiny things to fights". Unfortunately, he was caught by "at least 5 hics" shortly after landing in Erila.

In [a public post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4kgf3o/project_mayhem_revenant_down_to_test/d3ercyp), TEST pilot and FC Vily elaborated on the operation, which was set up to hunt [16-13] ships in the Erila area after the destruction of a TEST dreadnaught. The Naglfar used as bait was almost lost to a [16-13] Phoenix and Archon before Damien's Revenant jumped into system. The Naglfar lit a cyno and TEST reinforcements poured into Erila, destroying the [Archon](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54153034/), [Phoenix](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54153039/), and finally, [the Revenant](https://zkillboard.com/kill/54153050/).
