# Phaedan Bedtot
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/phaedan-bedtot

**Phaedan Bedtot** is the husband of [Jania Bedtot](56BeuvPy8Z92016R3TH5ER) and father of
[Adara](38mR2djgLfz4rZhoNps85G). He apparently used to visit her
regularly, and they spoke over relays when they worked. It seems the two
have not met in some time, however, and may be estranged. Under torture,
Jania promised to bring Phaedan to [Outpost 4972](7lJLYLN8srQsuRHZJsCfVR).
