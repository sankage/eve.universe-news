# Cerb Rausolle
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/cerb-rausolle

**Cerb Rausolle**, aka "The Astrologer," was the leader of the [25ers](3XtdtI2Z8UIELt1J3aaGsh). The Astrologer is perhaps most famous for demonstrations against [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) ship licenses, eventually blowing up a ship filled with explosives which brought an end to the CONCORD ship license program.

The Astrologer, now a fugitive after his stunt, quickly became a living legend. The 25ers organization was dismantled and the Astrologer lost his status as the champion of the people. But his name is not forgotten, nor that of the 25ers, and every now and then a new group is formed somewhere in the world of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), proclaiming itself as the successor of the old 25ers, dreaming of reliving the times when the little men defeated the big guns.
