::: COMMUNIQUE FROM THE OFFICE OF YONIS ARDSIHAPUR, LORD OF HOUSE ARDISHAPUR AND HEIR TO THE HOLY THRONE OF THE AMARRIAN EMPIRE :::

::: TO ALL 24th IMPERIAL CRUSADE CAPSULEERS :::

"Valiant crusaders of the 24th, I am Yonis Ardishapur, Royal Heir and devout follower of God's one true way."

"Yesterday we confirmed the discovery of a resting place holding the remains of holy Saint Anam.  While this would ordinarily be a cause for great celebration in our Empire, this Saint's tomb remains in the Kourmonen system, which is currently occupied by the Minmatar Republic."

"We cannot let these heathens locate and defile this holy resting place: we must return the Saint's remains to a site worthy of his stature.  I command you in the name of the Ardishapur Family and all that is Holy and True to go forth and reclaim the Kourmonen system"

"Glory to God and the Empire!"
