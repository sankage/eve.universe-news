Amarr Semiosis and Symbology
----------------------------

### Major Three and Minor Three

Symbols are very important to the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo). Three basic
symbols in particular are of vital importance to Amarr theology with,
three additional symbols derived from these three.

### The Major Three

The original symbol is that of a circle with a triangle at its base.
This symbol represents the unity of the first men and God.

The second symbol comes from the dark times when man sinned and existed
separately from God; two semicircles, one with a triangle at its base
sitting above the other.

The third symbol is the Imperial Seal and represents the Empire as it
exists today, with man rejoined imperfectly with God. It features a
semicircle with a triangle at its base superimposed over a normal
semicircle.

### The Minor Three

The first derived symbol is the [Khanid](1dQRsN9IAaCTVkatH4haam) Royal
Seal, which is the Imperial Seal inverted. It is interpreted to
represent the primacy of man's law over God's law.

The second derived is the second Major symbol inverted. Though it has
many interpretations, the only one that is considered correct by the
Amarr is that the Imperial Creed is part of the Amarr heritage, but
their future is among the stars.

The sixth symbol is too taboo for discussion. From unofficial records,
it is the first major symbol inverted, thus implying man's rule over
God.
