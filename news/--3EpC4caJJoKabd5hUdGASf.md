# Gallente Bloodline
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/gallente-bloodline

Descendants of ancient settlers on the planet [Gallente Prime](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a) in the Luminaire system, **Gallente**
value freedom and individual liberty above all else. Founders of the
[only true democracy](50Q1BNUHpwZCZBn7VqBL18) of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), they have created an ethnically
diverse, culturally rich, progressive society that encourages enterprise
and initiative in its citizens. While slow to anger and occasionally
indecisive, they are also capable of harnessing enormous military and
economic resolve when tested: either by the charismatic leadership of a
national icon, or by the searing injustice inflicted by a national
enemy.

Racial Traits
-------------

Gallente males tend to be highly ambitious and inquisitive, though also
opinionated. Honesty is the most valued virtue among them, and in their
eyes the views of conscientious objectors and altruists earn just as
much respect as those of famous leaders or war heroes. Gallente men are
generous in their friendships but also make ardent adversaries. They are
widely recognized for their selflessness and valor in times when they
sense that the freedom of others is threatened.

Born to work hard and play hard, Gallente females have a zest for life
that is often times contagious. Assertive yet kind, their spirit is
outgoing and lively. They are the model of self-empowerment, and can be
very creative and resourceful. Extremely confident individuals, no
profession is beyond their reach.

Ancestries
----------

### Activists

Gallente citizens tend to be more politically
aware than the citizens of other nations, and many devote their efforts
towards one or more of a multitude of causes that suit their ambitions.
For such an activist, things might not be perfect, but things will never
change for the better unless someone has the courage to fight the good
fight.

### Miners

While every spacefaring nation relies on mining the rich bounty of space
for resources, the Gallente esteem their miners as the key providers
that supported the rise of their civilization. Mining is a cultural icon
for the Federation, which credits the pioneers of this industry as
having selflessly braved the remote dangers of space to help pave the
way for exploration and growth. Driven by consumerism and ambitious
mega-projects, the Gallente Federation continues to generate heavy
demand for minerals, and as a matter of national pride loathes
dependence on other nations to acquire them.

### Immigrants

No other nation is as welcoming to immigrants as the Gallente
Federation. Between the huge demand for labor, the libertarian culture,
and social policies of the government, hard-working immigrants of every
race, creed, and color can build a dream life in the Federation, the
land of opportunity.
