# Girani-Fa incident
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/girani-fa-incident

The **Girani-Fa incident** was an incident between the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) around YC 95. At the time, the Federation and
the Empire clashed over ownership of the mineral rich system Girani-Fa,
located close to both their borders. After the Empire discontinued
negotiations with the Federation delegation, the dispute seemed to be
headed straight for all-out war.

But a few days later an extraordinary thing happened. The Amarr declared
that while they were ready to continue negotiations, they would only
conduct them with representatives from the [Quafe](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6) Company, claiming the latter were the only group within the Gallente
Federation with enough vested interest on both sides of the border to be
able to look at the matter from a neutral perspective. The Gallente
government, looking to avoid war, agreed to these requests and so a
delegation made up of top Quafe Company executives was sent to meet with
the Amarr delegation. A few weeks later an agreement was reached: the system would remain under Amarr sovereignty, while the Gallente would be free to mine there as long as they sold a fixed amount of minerals to the Amarrians each year at cost price.
