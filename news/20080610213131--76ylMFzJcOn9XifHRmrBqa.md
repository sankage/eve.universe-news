Khanid Prime - In a recent announcement King Khanid II declared martial law throughout Khanid Kingdom, in response to the cluster-wide turmoil. "All Khanid border systems are being reinforced by the Royal Khanid Navy," announced the King in his address to the nation. "Khanid Border Police have full authority to fire on anyone entering or leaving border systems until such time as this crisis has passed." 

Khanid military vessels have been spotted heading for the borders, with an even larger number setting up defensive positions around Khanid Prime. Fortifications are being hastily erected as the Navy takes all available measures to ensure the security of its sovereign space.
