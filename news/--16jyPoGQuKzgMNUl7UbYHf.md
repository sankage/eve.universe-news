# The Solari Constructs
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-solari-constructs

The **Solari constructs** are ruins.

Floating deep in a backwater constellation of the Forge lies a peculiar
ruin. Just 5,000 km from the Wirashoda Star lies the remains of an
impressive monument as well as an old mining rig. It's a testament to
the builders that the construct's heat shielding has endured as long as
they have.
