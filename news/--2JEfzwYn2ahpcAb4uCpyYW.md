Janus Bravour was [Tibus Heth's](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG) most trusted
lieutenant, in charge of implementing Heth's reforms and removing those
considered undeserving from their positions of power and replacing them
with those Heth determined had the right to be there, though some viewed
him as Heth's antithesis.

Upon his mysterious death, the media reported he had suddenly became ill
and was hospitalized with a serious condition, only to pass away.
