# Javies

**Javies** is the personal manservant of [Bethora](5wsvjWAtEn3fgbxYCq7eG3).
He is apparently a very competent employee, having served Bethora for
decades.

Because of his long years of service, he is occasionally allowed some
leeway in his personal behavior. Javies is noted as being extremely
fastidious. He travels with Bethora on all official trips, and is
notable for his willingness to undertake duties younger men blanch at.

During Bethora's stay at an orbital station (where she was attending the
race her [son](7bRDME40tMpJRpS2MtG1NC) participated in), he constantly cleaned
whenever they were on board, as he thought the station staff did an
inadequate job.
