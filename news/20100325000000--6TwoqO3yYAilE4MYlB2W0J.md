Pashanai - The Scope is still attempting to get news on the explosion that apparently ripped through the Ministry of War's Bureau Offices in the Pashanai system. Reports are coming in, but the explosion's cause and the extent of damage remain unclear.

What is clear is that the Amarr Navy has begun a massive re-deployment along its border with the Minmatar Republic. We have no comment from the Navy at this time.
