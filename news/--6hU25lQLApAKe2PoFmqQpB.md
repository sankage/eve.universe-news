# Ardishapur Decree
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/ardishapur-decree

The **Ardishapur Decree** is an Imperial law that states that all males
of the [Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) must amputate
their right hand at birth.

Background
----------

The [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) royal [Lady Phanca](6WUTZ07bOgCExrrUG0sN9M) kept a furrier and lavished it with
love. When [Uri Ardishapur](544JRCbSvLEGko9J3ARQwm) killed the
furrier at the lady's dinner table, Lady Phanca was so incensed she
convinced [her son](6Dhz7HjegSpFQc36TepEJ9) to sever Uri's right hand.
Ever since, all royal members of the Ardishapur family have had their
right hand amputated at birth and replaced by a
[cybernetic](5qIWvxsa4ayo3MzGijHspk) silver one, a tradition known as
the Ardishapur Decree.
