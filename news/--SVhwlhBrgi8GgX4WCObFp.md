# Carlos
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/carlos

**"Carlos"** is a [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) man with a drawn-out accent. His knees crack and he smells of sweat. He is short and stocky with muscles that had started turning to fat. His hair, beard and clothes are all of trim cut, but dirty and grimy. His eyes look tired.

He was nick-named Carlos by [Sebastian](5XvDRS1t6l5P9mK4ycTU6S) because he seemed the most human of the three interrogators.
