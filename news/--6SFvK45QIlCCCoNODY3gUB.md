# Jin-Mei
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/jin-mei

Original inhabitants of the [Lirsautton](4vX2JFJxrnpRAKUN8ZAO2L) System,the nation of **Jin-Mei** is the latest addition to the Federation, voluntarily joining just before the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) made contact with the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo). The Jin-Mei took to the stars comparatively late, as it took generations for them to transform their rigorous caste system. Before this change, many qualified individuals were excluded from consideration for purely class-based reasons. Despite being at odds with the libertarian culture of the Gallente, the caste system has not been completely eliminated, nor is it likely to be further discouraged by the Federation government due to its cultural implications.


Racial Traits
-------------

The Jin-Mei male is generally carefree and good-humored about all things
except his class status, which is of critical importance to his personal
well being. Favoring security and stability, Jin-Mei men tend to harbor
an aversion to change unless it guarantees an advance in social
standing.

Jin-Mei females tend to be bigger risk-takers than their male
counterparts, especially where it concerns advancing their own social
standing. Keenly receptive to changes with cultural ramifications,
Jin-Mei females were the largest supporters of lowering the social
barriers to spaceflight.

Ancestries
----------

### Sang Do Caste

The Sang Do (Ji., "lord") caste is the ruling class in Jin-Mei society.
To their credit, they tend to rule with a benevolent and charitable
hand, unlike many other societies with a similar caste hierarchy. With
inspiring demeanors and insightful natures, they have a distinct talent
for winning loyalty from those under their dominion.

### Saan Go Caste

The Saan Go (Ji., "standing high") are the "upper-middle class" within
the social hierarchy of the Jin-Mei. They are most commonly employed as
governmental officials and corporate directors. Resilient and amiable,
they are generally well-educated and practical thinkers.

### Jing Ko Caste

The Jing Ko (Ji., "good spirit") is composed of both middle and lower
classes in Jin-Mei society. While the majority of this caste toils in
obscurity, a select few of exceptional talent manage to rise above the
masses. These driven, highly disciplined individuals usually attach
themselves to a Saan Go or perhaps even a Sang Do patron, a relationship
that can pave the way for their continued advancement.
