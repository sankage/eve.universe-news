Altrinur, Metropolis - Thukker Mix CEO, Egar Aldinold, has called on Republic and Tribal authorities to crackdown on the Hrada-Oki Caravan following acts of theft. Members of the caravan masqueraded as Thukker Mix workers in order to infiltrate a Thukker Mix station and stage an illegal convoy. The Hrada-Oki caravan is a Thukker clan notorious for its criminal activities and known to be associated with the Deathless Circle. 

Yesterday, a group of Hrada clan members managed to register themselves as transport specialists and infiltrate a Thukker Mix Factory in orbit around Altrinur XII. Once they infiltrated the station, they stole a variety of items stored there, including combat probes, relic analyzers, synthetic synapses, and nanoelectrical microprocessors. 

Egar Aldinold had condemned the Hrada-Oki as “petty thieves and disrespectful anarchists who give all law-abiding Thukkers a bad name.” She called on both the Republic Security Services and the Republic Justice Department to take action against the renegades. She even went as far as to suggest that Ennar Aeboul, Chief of the Thukker Tribe, should banish them from the tribe. Chief Ennar Aeboul has yet to comment on this suggestion. However, sources close to the Thukker leader suggest that he has been seriously considering what action the tribe should take against these rebels.

The Republic Justice Department has investigated the Thukker Mix station in Altrinur following the Hrada-Oki infiltration. They have informed the Scope that their investigation has uncovered evidence that in addition to their theft of valuable items, they broke into a sealed containment area within the facility. According to legitimate Thukker Mix employees, no one working in the station was even aware that this containment area existed. 

The Scope has pulled the original blueprints of the station, and the sealed area is not present on them. Thukker construction teams have confirmed it was not present when the station was built. RJD agents have revealed that there are gaps in the archived security logs relating to the maintenance corridor on which this secret area is situated. These gaps date all the way back to YC113. Following yesterday's incursion the containment area is now unsealed and empty. According to Thukker scientists, the only evidence of what was once stored there are anomalous gravity stress fractures on the inside walls. 

Following their heist, the criminal clan formed up outside the station with a number of capsuleer accomplices. Due to their Thukker Mix credentials, they were not flagged by security forces. They then began moving as a convoy which is believed to have been headed toward Zarzakh. A group of Blood Raider hunters attempted to attack the convoy in Colelie, but were easily dealt with by the Hrada-Oki and their capsuleer escorts.

Despite their initial success, the Hrada-Oki’s flight was ultimately doomed. As soon as they left the safety of high-security space, however, the convoy was fired upon by capsuleer pilots. All the Hrada-Oki ships are believed to have been destroyed in this attack. Following this destruction, rumors have begun to surface about the contents of the caravan, including previously unseen devices called “Atavum”. According to these unsubstantiated rumors, there is evidence that some capsuleers completed the Hrada’s route and delivered these Atavum to the Fulcrum in Zarzakh. What the Deathless Cirtcle’s ultimate plan is for these mysterious items, however, still remains to be seen.
