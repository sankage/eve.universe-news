Luminaire - The Caldari Navy-led task force that has locked itself inside the Luminaire System is reportedly landing "hundreds of thousands" of dropships onto Caldari Prime following a systematic orbital bombardment of strategic defense emplacements all over the planet. The task force has achieved absolute space superiority in the system, as all Federation Navy and Customs warships inside the system have evidently been neutralized. However, despite its complete vulnerability, Gallente Prime is reporting clear space in its vicinity, with absolutely no sign of the invaders at this time. 

Military analysts consulted by Scope News have stated that the Caldari Navy appears to have committed "every resource at their disposal" to this colossal endeavor, and as such has left its rearguard flanks completely exposed to Federation counterattack.
