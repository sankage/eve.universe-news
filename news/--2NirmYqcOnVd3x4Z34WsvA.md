# Kapitan
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/kapitan

**Kapitan** is the nickname used by [Shan Arvonak](3z68XqdOxgMzUL53arlTGD) in reference to the Legionnaire who
once commanded Shan during a patrol of Curse space. Shan considers Kapitan to be a fat old bastard who has gone soft
after too many years with "those paper-pushing [Fed Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) pod-wetters". In the end, Kapitan
makes some poor strategic decisions during an encounter with two [Black Omega](black-omega) pilots which results in the destruction
of the entire patrol gang.
