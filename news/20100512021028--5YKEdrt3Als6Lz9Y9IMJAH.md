G-5EN2, Providence - Pilots can once again take part in the Auctoramentum Gladitorium; a gladiator style battle where competitors will fight for a top prize of 2 billion ISK.

 

The event sponsored by Revan Nefaris, Sovereign of the Sani Sabik faith, is to be held in the G-5EN2 system, recently controlled by Amarrian loyalists, as a show of honor for the new Faith that now rules the system. These games are dedicated to the "warrior-spirit...and to anoint the worlds of G-5EN2 with blood and courage through Sani Sabik ritual..." This tournaments battle style will be head to head duels, continuing until one pilot receives ten straight wins.
