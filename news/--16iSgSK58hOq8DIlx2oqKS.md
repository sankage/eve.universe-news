# Cold Wind
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/cold-wind

**Cold Wind** is a divine force among the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)
and a guiding force for its tribesmen, described as "the first of the
Winds to blow among the [Kaalakiota Peaks](tSXx52ZNNlyu2MYXtOiMT)
and the one that loves things that grow strong."

Cold Wind is seen as first of the Winds, the parent of all others; all
the Winds have their domains, but for Cold Wind he is everywhere. Cold
Wind is all the frosty air of Caldari Prime personified, the crisp,
clear air with a gentle morning breeze of a Caldari winter and the
punishing gales sweeping off the glaciers with the force to blow small
villages right off the map. All other Winds look up to him, and work
with him to shape the Caldari. To the Caldari, he was always near to
them and he was the one breathed the seeds of knowledge to their
ancestors. He welcomed them when they first came to the world and told
them the stories of its creation. Of all the spirits, he is the closest
to the Maker's will, and his love for the worthy and disappointment with
the unworthy is unmatched.
