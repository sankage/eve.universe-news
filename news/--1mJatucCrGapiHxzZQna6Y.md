# Rakan Dep
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/rakan-dep

**Rakan Dep** was the security officer at [Outpost 4972](7lJLYLN8srQsuRHZJsCfVR) during a notorious theft there.

Suspicion of theft
------------------

Rakan frequently visited the nearby settlements and gambled. Because of
this gambling, he rarely had much money saved, and when
[Szekel](2KLlyAO4njOMOllcdmqgtv) stole research data from the outpost, Rakan
- who was in constant need of funds - came under suspicion as a
collaborator.

Interrogation
-------------

During harsh interrogations, Rakan claimed to have never taken money
from people he shouldn't, though he admitted to taking money from people
he claimed who should have known better than to gamble, and for acting
as an intermediary for people who didn't want to get their hands dirty.

He steadfastly denied any involvement in the theft, even under torture.
Instead, he pinned blame on [Jania Bedtot](56BeuvPy8Z92016R3TH5ER), who
he suspected was having an affair with [Szekel](2KLlyAO4njOMOllcdmqgtv), and
he claimed had asked him to delete something from the outpost logs.
Rakan refused to break under torture and swore revenge once he got out.
