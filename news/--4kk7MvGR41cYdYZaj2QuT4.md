# HoloVision
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/holovision

**HoloVision** is a telecommunications medium for transmitting and receiving three dimensional moving images in either monochrome
(typically hues of gold or blue) or in full color. HoloVision may also
refer colloquially to the [holoprojectors](3R2yaSdkUb08ifof3FfTZd)
that receive the holovision transmissions. Today, HoloVision is, along
with traditional television, one of the primary broadcast methods in
[New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).

History
-------

HoloVision was first developed by the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
during the waning years of the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV).
The technology to produce
projected holograms had been in existence for some time, but this was
typically restricted to large holoprojectors reading from bulky
holoreels. Movie theaters and closed-circuit networks were typically the
only ones to utilize it extensively.

The major developments that brought HoloVision into mass use were a
reduction in the size of holoprojectors and a method of transmitting the
programs that would not clog the airwaves. HoloVision is thus more a
triumph of miniaturization and data compression than anything else, as
the technology entered the hands of the general public.

The first HoloVision broadcast was a nightly news reading by [The Scope](jKoaYpOfHALTiwPIlGbE6) on [Gallente Prime](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a). It was thirty minutes long and was
simulcast as a traditional television broadcast. The HoloVision
broadcast did marginal ratings numbers, as the technology had not been
adopted by a wide number of people, but the concept had been proven.

In the coming months, other entertainment companies jumped on the
technology. [Impetus](hph5RyllJ61G3aO6A0m4g), with its already broad
holoreel investments, was one of the primary backers of the technology.
They saw its potential to open a new avenue of consumption for their
myriad holoproductions. Within the year, nearly every newly produced
Impetus holoprojector was outfitted to receive HoloVision signals.

The technology eventually spread to the other empires;
[NOH](4Ykng1Buej1uH3Sy5ln3jW) was particularly interested in
bringing it to the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy). They initially made
several attempts to replicate the technology from scratch, though theirs
had lower quality than the Gallente's broadcasts. After the war was
over, however, they secured licenses to examine the original blueprints
and used this to improve their own tech.

The [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) received the technology from the Caldari,
via the [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj). The
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp), whom had to rebuild much of their
infrastructure from scratch following the
[Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N), picked up the technology
last. It has, however, achieved much greater market penetration in the
Republic because much of their infrastructure was produced with
HoloVision broadcasts in mind, as opposed to repurposing older tech as
in the other empires.

Technology
----------

HoloVision is broadcast as a digital data stream through the [fluid
routers](4w6FgQepyWkx0g0zXZctHM), allowing a program to be delivered
nearly instantaneously across the entire cluster. The data packet is
extremely compressed, utilizing high-level encryption unique to each
content provider. The data packet is unencrypted and decompressed
locally by the holoprojector through algorithms supplied by content
providers. The algorithms are stores in a tuner box that is typically
rented \- though sometimes purchased \- by the consumer.

Distribution
------------

Roughly 45% of all individuals in New Eden own or have access to a
family-owned HoloVision set. The majority of HoloVision sets are in the
core-areas of New Eden, where the broadcast infrastructure is the most
developed. HoloVision becomes increasingly rare the further removed from
the core worlds a system is. The nullsec regions have only minimal
access to infrastructure required to carry HoloVision, though recent
[capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) development has enabled it to spread
somewhat.

Among the empires, HoloVision has the highest market share in the
Minmatar Republic, with nearly 60% of individuals having access to a
HoloVision set. This is typically owed to fact that, when HoloVision
technology was fully realized, the Minmatar had not fully rebuilt their
broadcast infrastructure following the Minmatar Rebellion, allowing them
to utilize relay towers specifically designed to carry HoloVision
signals. The other empires, conversely, typically retrofitted and
repurposed older relay towers, resulting in lower quality signals.

The Gallente Federation comes in second, with a 55% market penetration.
However, this number is highly stratified, with shares approaching 100%
in large population centers such as Luminaire, and dwindling to near 0%
in the outskirts of Solitude. The Caldari State follows with a 45%
share, though it is unusual in that a large number of its sets are owned
by groups rather than individuals. Many corporate workers living in
employee housing do not own their own personal sets, but rather use one
owned by an entire floor or building.

The Amarr Empire comes in last, with only 30% of individuals having
regular access to a HoloVision set. The majority of these are the
nobility or wealthy merchants. Commoners and slaves make due with older
television sets or nothing at all.

Programming
-----------

A nearly unfathomable amount of HoloVision programming is produced on a
yearly basis. It covers everything from elaborately produced Gallente
dramas to low-budget Amarr religious sermons recorded and broadcast by
local churches. It is estimated that if one person were to watch every
first-run HoloVision broadcast during a single hour, it would take a
year to finish.

In practice, the majority of programs are limited to the areas where the
producers have broadcast rights. These rights can range from as little
as a single continent or city on a planet, all the way up to
empire-wide. No group has first broadcast rights in every area of New
Eden, though the Scope comes the closest. It has restricted rights to
broadcast in the Caldari State and none in the Amarr Empire, though the [Amarr Certified News](28MkJ06YGbcddv1x3BLBOt) has an agreement
to rebroadcast certain Scope programs.

Impetus is the largest producer of original HoloVision programming,
churning out hundreds of thousands of hours of content yearly. NOH comes
just behind and rarely outpaces them on a monthly basis. The Scope,
[Egonics Inc.](41x1mlLjrAPNSQCibjqWLQ), [Quafe Company](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6), [The Leisure Group](3c9YEVgoFJUIvDZMbAqZJk), [Echelon Entertainment](18L4RdCXWRddhsDTuM9hlG), and the Amarr Certified News are the other large-scale producers of HoloVision programming in New Eden. Thousands of smaller corporations exist to create local content.

Competing Technology
--------------------

HoloVision mainly has to compete with television broadcasts for its
market share. The majority of programming in New Eden is simulcast for
both television and HoloVision. This is a financial drain on many
companies, but as television continues to hold a 40% market share
throughout New Eden, it is a necessary one. There have been repeated
plans for expanding HoloVision's reach, but progress has been slowed in
recent years by conflict.

Many reasons exist for HoloVision having not reached full market
penetration. The major issues all revolve around cost. On the consumer
side, a holoprojector can cost two or three times as much as a
television of similar image quality. In many poorer areas, especially
planets without their own local electronics manufacturing sector, the
differential can be pronounced.

On the producer side, equipment to produce HoloVision broadcasts is more
costly than traditional video. While this is insignificant to most
large- and medium-scale producers, many small-scale planet-based
producers simply don't have the budgets to keep up. While many
holoprojectors can also play 2d video, they often require adaptors to
pick up television signals and the quality of the 2d playback is often
inferior to that of a monitor.

Finally, on the carrier side, a large number of outlying relay towers
are older models, deployed generations before HoloVision became
widespread. While many of these have been refitted to carry HoloVision
signals, many others have not. Those that have been refitted are often
strained by carrying the highest quality HoloVision signals and
[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) regulations require that communications
have top priority over entertainment broadcasts. During times of high
comms traffic, this can lead to interrupted HoloVision service. While
television can technically have the same issue, its lower bandwidth
requirements make this much less likely.

Replacing the older towers with updated models designed to carry
HoloVision signals is extremely costly. No single entity has been
willing to pay the full costs of refitting them, while attempts to
broker agreements between the many competing companies has proven
extremely difficult.

Additionally, many people simply prefer two-dimensional video to
three-dimensional holovideo. Television images are crisper, cause less
eye-strain, and easier to follow than holovideo. Some producers also
prefer it, as it limits the frame of vision of a viewer, allowing for
different styles of shooting to create certain artistic effects.
