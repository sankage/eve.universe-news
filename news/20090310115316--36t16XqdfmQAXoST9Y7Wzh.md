KOURMONEN - The missing Amarr Navy scout patrol has been recovered near the Kourmonen system. After re-establishing communication, the patrol was able to return to their position with the fleet. At this moment, the patrol has sustained no discernible losses, and has issued several benign comms in local channels. The fleet was instructed to use only scrambled communications until the patrol was found.  
  
In the moments following the Amarr Navy alert, the Republic Fleet deployed ships in the Auga system and declared a defensive stance, denying any involvement in the missing Amarr patrol while emphasizing their intent to defend their space.   
  
No official response has been issued from the Amarr Navy. The Navy remains at maximum alert in Kourmonen, and all communications are now scrambled.
