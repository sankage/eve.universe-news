# Storm Wind
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/storm-wind

**Storm Wind** is one of the Caldari spirits.

Storm Wind is the fiercest of the Winds, aside from an enraged Cold
Wind, but also has a playful side, dancing among the peaks and teasing
Mountain Wind. Storm Wind is the pelting rain of the mountain highlands,
crackling as it turns to sleet, the flash of lightning and boom of
thunder, and the smell of ozone. Storm Wind is a force of battle, of man
against man and man against the elements, the hottest forge to fashion
the strongest steel. Storm Wind is especially important to the Caldari
military, whose funerals are often scheduled to occur in the middle of
poor weather as an offering.

Other divine entities include [Wind-of-the-West](3FsbhfAVn48VZcWAXiTReI), [Cold Wind](16iSgSK58hOq8DIlx2oqKS), [Heart-of-the-Forest](3zH6qMixgVJtQUgHF3KFFM), and [Mountain Wind](NEtuLo38zgFK9ZA0sGYCk).
