# Day of Darkness
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/day-of-darkness

The **Day of Darkness** is the name given by the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) to the day of first contact with the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo), a day which also saw the worst storm
in the recorded history of [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6).

Historical Overview
-------------------

The Amarr first discovered the Minmatar early in 22355 AD. They were the
largest civilization the Amarr Empire had thus far encountered, and the
first that had settlements outside of their own system. Determining them
a potential threat, the Empire spent a long time covertly assessing the
Minmatar's capabilities and defenses, and, finding them sorely lacking,
waited only for the proper opportunity to strike.

In 22480, when a large storm hit the continent of Coricia on Matar, the
Amarr launched a swift first strike, destroying space installations and
shipyards all throughout [Pator](7MdCKy2OEJTpJSItRgx8DX), and throwing the
Minmatar chain of command into chaos.

With the storm and military attacks over, the Amarr deployed six massive
slave vessels to different planets in Pator, and scooped up the
survivors. The colonies on Belogor, Varkal, and Kulheim were completely
depopulated during this raid. On Huggar and Syld, the colonies lost over
half their populations, while on Matar, the Minmatar put up a fierce
resistance on the surface. However, having known no large-scale warfare
for centuries, and with their infrastructure in shambles as a result of
both the storm and the precision of the Amarr military strikes, they
were unable to prevent the Amarr from enslaving hundreds of millions on
Matar alone. This was the largest of the slave raids that would continue
for the next millennium that would see the enslavement of hundreds of
millions more.

While the Amarr clearly took advantage of the storm, they did not have a
hand in causing it. There is some evidence to suggest the massive storm
on this day was the result of worsening weather in general caused by
climate change and tidal disruptions. While the climate change is
normally attributed to the effects of industrialization, a highly
unpopular theory put forth in recent years suggests the Minmatar legend
of the harvested moon may have been real, and that the harvesting of
this moon was the cause of both the tidal disruptions and the climate
change.
