# Goral
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/goral

**Goral** is a [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) farm world. The population of the entire system that held Goral relied on the planet for food. The planet was hit with famine years ago when a Gallente [titan](XH5ZPvSBGGIStAEWqWHOl) was parked in orbit, wreaking havoc on the planet's tides, flooding cropland. Ever since, titans have had built-in fail-safes to prevent such a thing from happening again.
