# Guristas Pirates
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/guristas-pirates

Formed by two former members of the Caldari Navy, the pair go by the names [Fatal](2cUo2UbsCruVr7VsIHmw1N) and the [Rabbit](3Mb6UfjhKf0MdSbbR4a2EU), the Guristas are a constant thorn in the side of the Caldari State. The Guristas are traditional pirates in the sense that their operation is not based around some creed or ideology, but rather a plain and simple greed.

The Guristas have bases close to Caldari space and from them they embark on daring raids, often into the State itself. Though the Guristas are considered more honorable than many of their counterparts, they are still extremely dangerous and not to be tampered with.
