 **Yulai, Genesis** \- A new database allegedly collated by the Directive Enforcement Division [DED] of CONCORD purports to contain quarantined portions of [Sansha's Nation's](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sansha%27s_Nation) network traffic and capsuleer documentation of Nation incursions.

Capsuleers can send video footage and camera drone images to the DED through their [GalNet contact point](mailto:ihavereturnednews@gmail.com) or to the [Interstellar Correspondents](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=submitrp) through the usual routes.
