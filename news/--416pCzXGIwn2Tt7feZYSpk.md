# Stargates

**Stargates**, also known as **jump gates**, are the primary means of
interstellar travel in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).

The theory and technology behind stargates opened up a whole new era in
the history of mankind and is readily accepted as being one of the most
important discoveries of all times. Jump gates have now been in usage
for centuries and new versions appear regularly that make them more
sophisticated and safe.

Operational uncertainty
-----------------------

Even if the functions of jump gates are well known from a theoretical
point of view, there still remain a lot of unanswered questions about
the fundamentals of dimensional inter-connections. Naturally, many
theories exist on the subject, but none are comprehensive enough to
fully explain how the universe is divided into many dimensions and the
connections between them, some also touch upon the subject of
hyperspace, an alternative plain in another dimension. About the only
statement these theories agree upon is that these issues are definitely
not as simple as they seem on the surface. However, these theories are
still a topic of research, and stargate technology is being continually
refined, with new jump gate designs appearing regularly to improve
safety and efficiency.

Part of a stargate's operation involves the use of superheated plasma,
which can be vented into space. If vented improperly, it is possible
that the plasma may be attracted away from the jump gate's boson sphere
toward an approaching ship, where it may react with the ship's shields
to produce a harmless visual phenomenon, such as the
[Lutins](4QBHzmS7145cgUWIpghBqV) observed near the Perimeter gate in
[Iyen-Oursta](5UH2LQJuHPZw0izWU685Wl).
