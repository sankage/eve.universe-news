# Tea Maker Ceremony
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/tea-maker-ceremony

The **Tea Maker Ceremony** is a method of resolving disputes or (more
likely) allowing for honorable suicide for the weaker party in a dispute
among [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy).

In the ceremony, one party to the dispute forces the other party to
drink poisoned tea, with the reasoning that if the other party survives
they will have received divine favor.
