# Shintaht
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/shintaht

**Shintaht** is a solar system near [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) space. It
was originally surveyed by the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy). Both the
Caldari and Amarr have claimed the system, though neither side has
settled it. It is home to [Konrakas](pTNoH71MqJLbHASxLpOgp), a
mineral-rich but inhospitable planet that has yet to be exploited.
