# Arzad Hamri
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/arzad-hamri

**Arzad Hamri** was a [Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) of the Hamri family
under [Arkon Ardishapur](17tWRlpXtkWqoUBdAdWGxN).

Historical Background
---------------------

Little is known about this enigmatic man after a concerted effort took
place to have his name removed from the history books of the Amarr Empire. There are mentions of him in [Ardishapur](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) house records, mainly in
connection with his trial for heresy, and his subsequent execution. Most
of what is known about the man himself comes from the
[Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw), who refer to him as Torus Arzad, or
St. Arzad.

### Early Life

Born the son of Ezzara Hamri, grandson of Yuzier Hamri, Arzad spent most
of his life on [Starkman Prime](hhT3DOiMGuhLQl0vmNbuY). As a young
man, he would spend hours in the fields with the slaves, working along
side them. He studied the customs and traditions of the Starkmanir,
though his father and his elders disapproved. Arzad's understanding
of Amarr [Scripture](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp) (and the Theology Council's interpretation of it) allowed
him much leeway.

### Rise in Popularity

When Arzad ascended to the title of [Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v), his
first act was to grant a day of rest to his slaves, naming it Hand of
Solace, and institutionalizing it as a holy day on his holdings. He
would grant his slaves many such days of rest and parlay. Even
before this, Arzad had enjoyed great popularity among the slaves on his
holdings, and his reputation would only grow.

By the end of his tenth year as Holder, Arzad had established a network
of education centers aimed not only at integrating the Starkmanir into
Amarr society, but also as a way of educating the Hamri family in the
ways of the Starkmanir, such as woodworking and astronomy.

Arzad had also refashioned an Amarr symbol of divine authority with
blood-obsidian orb native to Starkman Prime. Naming it the Wildfire
Scepter, Arzad would bestow this symbol on any of his slaves that he
felt had attained a high degree of understanding of the Amarr
religion.

### Trial and Death

Growing increasingly uncomfortable with the precedents Arzad was
setting, and his growing popularity, the Theology Council finally
succeeded in bringing charges against him. Citing his misuse of an Amarr
religious symbol, he was charged with treason and blasphemy. Arkon
Ardishapur, long-time friend of Arzad and the Hamri family, was forced
into presiding over the trial, and though he had planned to let Arzad
off with a warning, special prosecutors sent by the Theology Council
itself saw him convicted as a heretic and put to
[death](5WNhh1Tm9Ucm0ni1HgOotc). Copies of the Wildfire scepter were
rounded up and destroyed, and Arzad's name was then expunged from the
records as much as possible, though the system which contained Starkman
Prime would retain his name.

### After Death

According to Starkmanir legend, three months after his death, Arzad
appeared in a field to a lone Starkman youth named [Drupar Maak](4jYB1gA3QgB54Pi5vxP3Em). Arzad is supposed to have handed him
a Wildfire Khumaak, leaving it with him along with words of
encouragement. Many years later, Drupar Maak would avenge Arzad's death
by striking down Arkon Ardishapur with his own scepter. These scepters
would forever come to be known as the Hand of Maak, or
[Khumaak](4ivJZ5FQKTtduznzfOVMmn), and its use as a divine symbol of
authority forever tainted.
