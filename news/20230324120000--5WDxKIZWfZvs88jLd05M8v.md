### DED and EDENCOM Security Briefing Highlights Concerns Over Empires "Shadow War" Violence 

Yulai, Genesis – DED and EDENCOM leadership highlighted "serious concerns" over the rising violence associated with the so-called "Shadow War" between the core empires in a rare public briefing before the New Eden Cluster Security Committee (CSC) of the CONCORD Inner Circle, today. 

In particular, DED Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall noted the "significant increase" in capsuleer combat in high-security space due to conflict between suspect-flagged vessels at empire research facilities. Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir also reported on "increased mercenary and pirate activity associated with raids on research facilities", additionally noting that EDENCOM was tracking significant flows of illicit data, ISK, and advanced materials smuggled to locations spread across the outer regions of New Eden.

The DED's Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall and EDENCOM's Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir were addressing the New Eden CSC following a request from the Society of Conscious Thought's Elder Mentor Matshi Raish. The New Eden CSC is an evolution of the Inner Circle's "War Council", set up during the Triglavian Invasions, and includes appointees from all five member states of the Inner Circle, together with leadership of CONCORD's military, intelligence, and security branches.

The CSC briefing also heard a report from Colonel Oveg Drust, commander of the notorious "Red Troop" anti-warclone unit of SARO – CONCORD's Special Affairs for Regulations & Order division. Colonel Drust outlined recent activities in the Placid region, particularly in the militia warzone, and detailed the elimination of "terrorist front organizations and Triglavian-affiliated warclone cells" together with a brief mention of operations in conjunction with DERAIL – the Department for Enforcement of Restrictions on Artificial Intelligence and Life.

The New Eden Cluster Security Committee entered a closed session to hear further particulars on increased Triglavian activities, renegade warclone cells, and special operations associated with the CONCORD mandate to eliminate rogue AIs.

### Gallente Federation Senate Ratifies Non-Intervention Treaty with Amarr Empire

Villore, Essence – The Federation Senate has ratified a non-intervention treaty with the Amarr Empire, following the recommendation of President Celes Aguard, the Federal Security Council, and the Senate Subcommittee on Amarr-Gallente Relations. The "Treaty of Pashanai" was negotiated between the Empire and Federation following Caldari-Minmatar moves to a non-aggression pact and formalizes the ceasefire between Amarr and Gallente forces in the militia warzones. The ratification passed comfortably despite some opposition from the so-called "Bellaron Faction" of senators strongly opposed to President Aguard's military and diplomatic policies.

The Treaty of Pashanai has already been formally received by the Imperial Privy Council and ordered by Empress Catiz I to be promulgated as an element of Amarr scripture by the Theology Council. The entering of the non-intervention treaty into the Amarr scriptures will formalize it as part of the body of law of the Empire, meaning that the Treaty of Pashanai is now fully effective. With the the Treaty of Airaken between the Caldari and Minmatar in force, the Treaty of Pashanai brings to a complete end the previous system of military alliances that created two power blocs within the CONCORD empires.
