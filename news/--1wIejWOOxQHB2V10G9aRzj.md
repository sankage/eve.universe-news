Modern **video broadcasting technology** comes in all shapes and sizes in New Eden.

Holographic Displays
--------------------

The game of [Mind Clash](22qTwYMQWYFPScEBt16DVA), at least when played at major arenas, uses holographic displays to project the digital illusions
the players make battle with.

Flat displays
-------------

### General

Regular flat displays are also available. These are visible onboard stations.

### Interstellar business broadcasts

Vidscreens are used for communication between
[capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) and planetary or station personnel,
though only with the latter group. One notable example was between
[Omvistus](14Seg6wEOEpNHopnuUbUtZ), a capsuleer, and [Leonalle Yvesk](5qnge8y8YaWVmIoatjJv5E), a Planetary Administrator. Yvesk's
vidscreen was the size of an entire wall, and Omvistus was able to
project onto it whatever image he liked as an avatar of himself.

### Sports

Huge screens also dot the arenas where Mind Clash duels are held,
broadcasting images and information to the audience. These consist
mainly of things like close-ups of contestants or detailed data-charts
on the status of their mental and bodily state.
