Yulai - It seems that CONCORD's cluster-wide data network is suffering a severe and unprecedented outage. In the last few minutes multiple core services have degraded or dropped offline across the EVE cluster. This appears to be linked to events in Yulai; communications with that system have been re-established, and independent pilots are reporting in again.

We have been unable to contact or identify any vessels known to have been in the vicinity of the station prior to the attack. Reports suggest that multiple smaller engagements have broken out across the system as panicked pilots turn on local law enforcement vessels. It appears that at this time CONCORD is not deploying additional vessels into the system.
