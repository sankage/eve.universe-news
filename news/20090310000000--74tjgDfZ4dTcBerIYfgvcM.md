SEYLINN 1040 - Two Federation Navy dropships carrying survivors from Seyllin have collided on take-off, with the resulting wreckage killing an estimated 4000 people. The dropships were both reported to be carrying well over the two hundred permitted personnel for such vessels.  
  
Armed Marines have placed a cordon around the loading bays in an attempt to limit the amount of refugees being allowed to board.
