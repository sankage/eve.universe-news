Yulai â€“ Scope News has managed to wire a compressed packet from Yulai through an independent local transmitter. The images are distorted, but the unmistakable fleet of Minmatar-Thukker ships appear to be firing capital-class weaponry at the CONCORD Station. The space surrounding the station is lit up with explosions from weapons impacts and crippled capital ships breaking apart. Both sides seem to be suffering heavy casualties from the barbaric assault, with yet more CONCORD reinforcements arriving at the fight with every passing minute.
