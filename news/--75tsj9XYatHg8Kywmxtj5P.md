## Introduction

Warclones are a varied class of cloned humans whose augmented bodies are designed for military service on land, air, and in space. Very different to capsuleer spaceship pilots, warclones are most famously known to the general New Eden public as soldiers and aerospace craft crew. The latter are well-known to consumers of mass-media holovids as space fighter pilots. The former are increasingly prevalent in the militaries of the empires but are most notorious as mercenaries.
