September
=========

[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) and [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) Development
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Amarr manufacturing sector significant productivity increases
were anticipated from September, as numerous companies planned for
aggressive business strategies fueled by increasing volumes of high-end
minerals entering Amarr space. Elsewhere in the wider Amarr Empire, the
[Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) consolidation efforts
in the [Ammatar Mandate](4BV4ldw5RdVB4FxKctn4J6) were reported to be
widely welcomed by the [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) population. In
addition, a major program of hospital and religious building
construction in the Mandate further underlined the commitment of the
Ardishapur to regenerating the Derelik region. In terms of the region's
military infrastructure, the Mandate shipyards destroyed during the
Elder Invasion were reported to have been rebuilt and restored to fully
operational status.

The implications of the Caldari auction of occupied
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) systems were felt
across the Federation. The Ostingele III terraforming project was put on
hold and [Poksu Mineral Group](2Gl4T0AO5PDVR4lOMsUv5C) announced
its intention to take over administration of [Material Acquisition's](uU1699OxOEmlDBcMm0qZA) extraction and refining
operations in the Uphallant system. Many Gallente investors called on
the Federal government to guarantee assets annexed by the Caldari
corporations in the occupied systems. However, the Poksu takeover of
Mineral Acquisition's holdings in Uphallant was put on hold due to a
contractual dispute between Poksu and
[Nugoeihuvi](4Ykng1Buej1uH3Sy5ln3jW), the megacorporation
that had acquired development rights in the system. The uncertainty of
the Uphallant situation led the Gallente financial sector to heavily
criticize the [Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) administration but
it was unclear what the Gallente government could do about the matter.

Strains in the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) and Beyond
------------------------------------------------------------------

With the Servant [Sisters of EVE](2eTQAT2DL0C7TWVtkOr8pN) announcing
a transportation initiative aimed at providing transport for thousands
of emancipated slaves unable to afford to relocate out of the Amarr
Empire, news that religion was a continuing issue of contention in the
Minmatar Republic in the wake of the death of [Abel Jarek](5HDj1enu8OW6rTNg6d9dR8) highlighted the problems of absorbing and
assimilating former slaves, many of whom were sincere believers in the
Amarr faith. The efforts of former Ammatar Mandate industrialist Oguko
Hagori to sue Urban Management for control of land his family once
controlled also put a spotlight on the increased tensions within
Minmatar society due to the impact of the returning tribes. In the
event, the [Vherokior](6VDPzsKX9TVbVtXEwjj0RB) tribal court was to
rule against Hagori early the next month.

Some strain between the Minmatar Republic and the [Thukker Tribe](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z) was also exposed by the case of the
escaped Thukker crime lord Baliggan Krullefor. Although he had escaped
from a Minmatar prison, the Thukker recaptured Krullefor and then
refused to extradite him back to the Republic authorities. The matter
was resolved with an agreement that the Thukker would hold Krullefor in
their prison system for crimes against Thukker tribal law. Even so, the
affair had caused some discontent on all sides and the outcome was not
seen as satisfactory by many Republic citizens.

7th [Capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) Tournament
-------------------------------------------------

The 7th Capsuleer Alliance Tournament took place during the month and
was accompanied by the usual intense rivalry and thrilling contests,
made more intriguing still by the radical new rules limiting numbers of
ship classes in any given match. The tournament ended with Pandemic
Legion successfully defending their title against challengers
Circle-of-Two.
