Media attention of the Federation financial sector has grown notably in recent days as pundits begin to make predictions on the content of a report due from the Bank of Luminaire. Speculation has been building in recent months on the health of the Federation's economy and just how sustainable its growth rate truly is. 

In the past eighteen months the Federation has seen a swelling population fuelled by large numbers of Minmatar immigrants settling within Federation territories. This combined with other factors has seen the economy of the Federation undergoing a sustained period of rapid growth. 

Analysts have in recent months begun to question how long such growth will continue and what may happen should the economy begin to slow as has been seen over the border in the Caldari State. It is rumoured that the Bank of Luminaire has placed special emphasis on answering these concerns to calm the nations mood and that this quarters economic report may yield eagerly anticipated insights. 

Predictions of the report's findings vary wildly ranging from predictions of a looming bust to an escalation of economic growth proportional to further Caldari decline. While some pundits insist that a slowing of the economy is inevitable others point to Gallentean market successes in the area of capital ship production. The proliferation of Gallente engineered Obelisk freighters plying New Eden's shipping lanes is seen by many as an indicator of a robust trading industry. 

The economic powerhouses of the Federation are known to be monitoring the Bank of Luminaire's findings very closely, as are media pundits across Federal space and beyond.
