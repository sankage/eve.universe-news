## The Capsule

A little over 120 years ago, the elusive and radically advanced Jovian Directorate gifted a small Caldari megacorporation with the blueprint and designs for a piece of technology that was to radically change the fate of the human race.

For a small, select, and chosen group of individuals, those with the physical and mental durability to survive the transition into posthumanism, this technology would provide the gateway to power and riches beyond their wildest dreams and with it, near immortality.

This piece of technology is known today by most as the pod or capsule. To give the device its full name, we would call it the hydrostatic capsule, and we would call the pilot encased within its armored shell a capsuleer.

### Background

For thousands of years after the Dark Ages, when the Age of Expansion began, humanity fought a war against the ultimate paradox. The perils and sheer inhospitable nature of space travel versus the need to expand and colonize for our species to further develop itself.

Along the way over the last seven millennia, many historic and groundbreaking discoveries were made that changed the face of interstellar exploration: the rediscovery of warp technology, the construction of the first stargates since the devastating collapse of the EVE Gate, faster-than-light communication—all of which paled in comparison to the arrival of the hydrostatic capsule in terms of consequence for the human race.

A single device that, when melded with today’s cloning advancements and neural and nanotechnology, can grant those select few the gift of lightning fast reaction, command over the most powerful starships ever constructed with the power of thought alone, and most importantly for many, near immortality.

With the dawn of the capsuleer came a new age. The Age of Expansion was left behind, written into the books of New Eden's history as those chosen half a million or so pilots took to the stars, the tens of trillions they left behind looking up in awe and wonder.

In YC105, with the union between capsule and clone completed, the Empyrean Age had dawned.
