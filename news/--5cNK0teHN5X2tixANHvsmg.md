Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/daughters-of-the-revolution

The **Daughters of the Revolution** refers to girls born in the baby boom following the [Minmatar Rebellion](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp). On one planet, a group of revolutionaries grew into a violent mob before becoming even more tyrannical than the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) had been. After butchering and killing anyone who stood in their way they began to establish camps for forced labor, one kind for the men and another for the women. After they were killed, many babies were born who were mostly given away to foster families or to institutions.
