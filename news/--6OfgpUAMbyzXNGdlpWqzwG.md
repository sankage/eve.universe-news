# Row of Wings
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/row-of-wings

Housed on an unnamed ship repair station, the **Row of Wings** used to
snake its way through the main section. It was a series of ship parts,
most of them flat or wing-shaped, that ranged in height from that of a
short man to the size of a two-story building. In times past, the parts
had been used for education, both as reference pieces and as test
housing for new module variations. Each part was held in a frame that
consisted of two massive clamps on the floor and a wire at the top
attached to the nearest wall. An ancient control board could loosen the
clamps and cause the wire to fall away, allowing the piece to be moved
by a walker. The Row of Wings was destroyed in a retirement prank.
