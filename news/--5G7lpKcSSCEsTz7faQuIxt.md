# Jove Empire
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/jove-empire

__The Jove Empire__ is isolated from the rest of the world to all but a selected few. The Jovians are a mystery to the other empires, fueled not only by their elusiveness, but also their highly advanced technology, eons ahead of the other races. The Jovians have been civilized longer than any other race in the world of New Eden and have gone through several golden ages, now long-since shrouded in the past. The current Jovian Empire is only a pale shadow of its former self, mainly because of the Jovian Disease - a psychological disorder that is always fatal.
