**Kezti Sundara** is the Grand Admiral of the Imperial [Amarr Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g). At one point he met with a captain in a
cathedral inside an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) station. The two discussed
the Elder Invasion, the reappearance of [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L), and the war the Empire has found itself
in. Sundara seemed content to listen to the advice of his captain.
