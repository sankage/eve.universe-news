In a well attended ceremony in X6AB-Y, Lonewolfnight honored Lord Aralis by opening with a speech: 

“With great respect, pilots who have been touched by your wisdom and dedication are here today to pay respect to you. A great deal of people have come together to say thank you for your time and your dedication. Today’s event marks the beginning of a one week celebration of that date, and such, We have assembled a special gift for you. Before you is a complete Navy fit, Navy Issue Apocalypse to mark your dedication to the Amarrian Empire, CVA and the dream of Providence.” 

In a very orderly manner, several more speakers added their own best wishes and remembrances about the past five years. 

Lord Aralis, in a heartfelt voice, addressed his friends and colleagues: 

“I'm very proud to be a part of this and thank you all. It is nice to be appreciated - not that I ever don't feel appreciated! It's a great organisation we are part of and thank you for reminding me yet again. I hope that honour and loyalty will always be cornerstones of this alliance… Wisdom we'll just have to hope for! 

I've always thought one of the key jobs was keeping the good people in here in CVA and I think I and we have succeeded. I hope you're all as proud of us as I am. CVA is an amazing organisation and I'm very proud to be part of it. I can't quite figure how I ever came to be at the head of it. 

I'd like to point out that while I have been leading ID a long time I'm only one of four leaders that CVA has had. It's been a fair while but many have done a great job in getting us where we are now. Particular thanks on that front to Hardin who did the job brilliantly for ages before me. 

Thank you. Thank you all… May god give us a new Emperor!” 

Shortly after his speech, every pilot in the system introduced themselves and saluted Aralis. When the last pilot completed his salute, Lonewolfnight officially concluded the ceremony and most of the pilots retired to the station for some drinks and revelry. 

During a lull in the festivities, Lord Aralis was heard to remark: "Yes it was a total surprise! And even when I did see it coming at the last minute I was amazed how many turned up! I was proud of them just for that that they could involve so many people without me knowing! Obviously I was hugely honoured and touched, and proud of our great alliance and the people who make it. I strongly suspect the ship will sit as a prize to warm my heart forever. 

The vision going forward is the same as it has always been. To bring Providence into the empire and make it a centre of civilization and a showpiece of Amarrian glory. An example to a bewildered galaxy lost in godless violence and insanity."
