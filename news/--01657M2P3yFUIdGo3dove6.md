**Nanoids** are small machines which can do a variety of tasks, such as
manual labor in a greenhouse, where they could be tasked to turn earth
around plants into a slippery oil to assist in effortless uprooting.
Nanoids have pressure-sensitive arms which can retrieve delicate plants
from soil without harming them.
