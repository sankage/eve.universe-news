EDENCOM is the New Eden Common Defense Initiative, a semi-autonomous military command set up by CONCORD and the "Big 4" core empires to aggressively prosecute the war against the Triglavian Collective's invasion forces in YC122. With access to massive financial resources from the New Eden Defense Fund, EDENCOM organizes the fortification of threatened systems and the defense of New Eden by fleets and troops drawn from CONCORD and the empires.
