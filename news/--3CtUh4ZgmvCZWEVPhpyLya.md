# Hovertable
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/hovertable

The **hovertable** is, as the name implies, a large table able to hover
off the ground. Among certain practitioners of ancient
[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) arts - torture, that is - there exist versions
of the hovertable that can have people strapped to them.

Function
--------

The device moves automatically, but can also be adjusted to become
transparent and tilt forward. Previous versions apparently had technical
problems where whatever was laden on them would be randomly blasted off.
Its functions utilize magnetism and light.
