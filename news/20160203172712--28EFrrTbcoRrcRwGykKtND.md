This popular event has been attracted up to 200 EVE players in the past and is both rich in content and fun. The event offers a Friday night pub crawl and a whole day of activities and spaceship camraderie on the Saturday.

CCP Developers CCP Masterplan and CCP Lebowski will be in attendance. They are currently working on the Citadels expansion and the new capital mechanics so they'll have plenty to talk about.

We're also bringing our anticipated virtual reality dogfighting shooter  **EVE Valkyrie!**  This time attendees will get to play with the current Alpha build which has live online combat, new ship types and lots of updates and improvements over what we've demoed in the past.

We highly recommend EVE_NT and hope to see you there!
