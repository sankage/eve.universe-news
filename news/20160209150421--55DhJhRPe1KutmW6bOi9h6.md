Hello Capsuleers

[As announced by the Upwell Consortium](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/upwell-consortium-research-component-acquisition-to-conclude-midnight/), if you've been diligently collecting Research Components from the Serpentis [to return to the Upwell Consortium](http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/the-first-citadels-help-upwell-consortium-build-the-world-of-tomorrow/) make sure you contract them in to Lee Brinalle by 23:59 UTC on February 9, 2016. Any Research Components in contracts created after this time will not be accepted.

While most of [the prizes in the draw](http://www.eveonline.com/first-citadels/) have been unlocked, there is still a Fortizar Citadel BPC remaining to be acquired. If you want to have a chance to win one, keep submitting those Research Components.

The draw results will be announced before the end of February.
