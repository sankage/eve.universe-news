 **Catch** \- **Against ALL Authorities [.-A-.]** are currently fighting wars on two fronts, one in an attempt to free systems that were recently taken by **Libertas Fidelitas [LFA]** , with help from **Curatores Veritatis Alliance [CVA]** and a second against **GoonSwarm [OHGOD]** in 49-U6U.  
  
As of this time F9E-KX, SV5-8N, WD-VTV, and 9KOE-A have been taken by the Providence residents with capital fleets currently deployed by .-A-. and friends as they attempt to free F9E-KX and SV5-8N. With the fighting still in progress it looks possible that .-A-. may be able to recover SV5-8N, though reports indicate that they are taking losses of about five to one at the current time.  
  
More details will be published once they are available.
