# Ealur VI
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/ealur-vi

Ealur VI is the homeworld of the [Ealur](6TgmS6RKjOYM1Id08VBZzk).
Little knowledge survived on this world after the collapse of the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o).

The planet is warm and comfortable, with a short year. It is not
particularly mineral rich, though it does possess several large deposits
of precious metals and other natural resources.

The planet's biosphere was early in its life cycle, having only recently
transitioned from a cold, ice-covered world as its star's surface
temperature rose. Plant life had emerged within recent history,
providing the planet with a breathable atmosphere, but having not yet
given rise to large animal populations.

It seems likely that the original settlers were primarily interested in
colonization rather than short-term exploitation of the planet.
