# Industrials

**Industrials** are among the oldest class of ships in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk). Among the top requirements of any
truly space-based society is a method of hauling valuable goods in large quantities from one star system to the next. In the early days of interplanetary travel this function was filled by the same ships used
for combat, exploration, and scientific studies. However, as the empires
grew more stable and space travel became safer and affordable to more
than governmental entities, specialized ships became the norm. The basic
industrial design has remained unchanged for centuries, with the
essential concepts dating back to the earliest, sea-faring years of all
empires on their home planets.

History
-------

Industrials, or their early ancestors, rose out of the need for the
hauling of supplies from the homeworld to new colonies. As more and more
supplies were needed with greater frequency, it became quickly apparent
that multipurpose ships were ill-suited to the task. Not only did mixed
crews reduce efficiency and increase idle time, but valuable cargo space
was taken up by scientific and military equipment.

The earliest cargo vessels were little more than stripped-down versions
of their multipurpose cousins, with extra equipment torn out for
additional space. Improvements in layout and automation soon followed,
allowing smaller crews to handle more cargo with less effort. As the
safety of spacelanes improved, weaponry, shielding, and armor were all
reduced, lowering ship tonnage and further increasing available cargo
space.

It wasn't until the advent of space-based manufacturing that industrials
were truly born in the modern sense. Free of the necessity to launch a
ship from the ground or ever have it capable of landing on a planet,
builders were able to increase size to previously unseen levels.
Originally, this simply meant increasing the dimensions of old designs.

However, as had occurred before, technology was quickly applied to these
new designs, turning them from little more than massive flying vaults
into intricate, dedicated cargo haulers that made efficient use of every
available centimeter.

Design
------

Industrials may appear simplistic to outsiders, but their design is
quite complicated. The ship class has numerous internal compartments,
extensive conveyors connecting different parts of the ship, advanced
automation to pack cargo in the most efficient manner possible, and
robotic assistants to do lifting that a human could not manage.

While the exact layout differs between builders, the standard industrial
has dozens of different compartments, each designed to specific
standards for various types of cargo. As many as a thousand individual
compartments may exist on a single ship. Depending on the level of
safety anticipated in a journey, volatile goods may be stored in outer
compartments to minimize catastrophic ship damage in the event of an
accident, or kept deep in the center of the hull in order to reduce the
chance of an explosion caused by weapons fire.

Individual compartments are connected to each other, the
loading/unloading bays, and jet can launchers by conveyor belt. There
may be tens of kilometers of belts and passageways crisscrossing the
ship, ready to carry cargo from internal compartments to the outer bays.

These belts are normally fed by robotic arms and lifts which can handle
much larger weights and sizes than humans. In some cases these lifts are
human operated, especially in [slave](slavery)-crewed
[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) vessels, but for cargo that requires delicacy
and precision, [AIs](67UaJpJzvXXlhQc8a0GnWR) ensure no mistakes are made. For
smaller items, human crew is preferred for the speed with which they can
operate.

When it comes to getting the most out of an industrial's capacity, a
good set of automated procedures is of paramount importance, along with
familiarity with spacial dynamics on those ships flown by
[capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ). The best can make use of every last
centimeter of internal space, cramming in far more cargo than an
untrained captain with an outdated packing routine.

Crew
----

Because much of the internal running of an industrial can be safely
automated, they require far less crew than other
ships of similar sizes. Additionally, the functions on board an
industrial are much less skill-intensive than in others, meaning most of
an industrial's crew are little more than laborers who load and unload
cargo.

Industrials are often the first ship a rookie crew is assigned to, as
the staff are much less likely to cause a catastrophic failure through
inexperience. While the ships' functions are not difficult, they provide
valuable education and help crews get used to life on board a ship. The
ships are also favored for their perceived safety, as new recruits
typically believe cargo vessels will stick to high security spacelanes,
even if this is not entirely accurate.
