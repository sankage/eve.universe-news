# Sadrede Svarg
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/sadrede-svarg

**Sadrede Svarg** is an elder [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) statesman
and government official.

At one point he and his fellow official, [Aduner Hulmkelat](4y6T5MA4qy4Kn4NvbJUW8e), spent a few hours at the beach
during a break in government negotiations. Together, they visited the
sand sculptor [Elbrand Toudin](5RGi23lp6LgyLzQojxOa5N). Sadrede,
being the more lithe of the two, managed to slip into the crowd, where
he witnessed the three sculptures Elbrand was making. Sadrede expresses
contempt at the chaotic and inflammatory sculptures and, after taking in
all three, departed, seething over what he's seen.

When he saw a dancer performing the [Ruhste](6bF2N0edNBmreQIvpZC1u1), an
ancient tribal dance, he exploded in rage and began yelling at the
dancer, proclaiming the public displays only served to incite people and
did nothing to further any cause. The dancer laughed at him and he
stormed off.

When he saw [Bryld](6Qjylht5emiCCaJVOY1ozM), a child, playing with ChromIts,
he was fascinated by the incredibly intricate design the child had made.
He believed the child has done something of value, unlike the performers
from earlier. He believed the Minmatar should do peaceful work. He
maintained his enthusiasm even when Aduner pointed out the shortcuts and
imperfections in the child's design. The two then returned to their
negotiations with [Karin Midular](3KxlNVAeglPj5ZH0sf3U2j).
