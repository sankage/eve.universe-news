On the evening of the 14th by unanimous vote of all the militia members who attended the inaugral meeting of the **Secretariate, Kassasis Dakkstromri** was declared the first **Secretary General**.

We asked Mr Dakkstromri "How do you feel about being voted in as Secretary General?", to this he replied "It is a great honour that has been bestowed upon me by the citizens of this great State, I will endevour to do my best to ensure that the trust they have placed in me is justified."

Watch out if you are an enemy of the State, as the State is organised.
