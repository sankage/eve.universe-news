Aridia - Earlier reports that a fleet of Federation Navy vessels had crossed over the Gallente-Amarr border into Aridia have now been confirmed by several independent sources. Amarr Navy scout squadrons have reportedly been scrambled and are conducting long-range reconnaissance, but have made no move to engage yet. The Gallente vessels have failed to respond to all hails directed towards them, and top sources within the Federation Navy have reportedly disavowed any knowledge of their actions. The fleet, variously reported to number between sixty and one hundred unmarked vessels of diverse class and specification, was last spotted in the Noranim system in Genesis.

More on the situation as it develops.
