 **Detorid** - Recent events have escalated to a full scale conflict and whilst preliminary reports from the HZFJ-M solar system are still fragmented, they depict a fight of epic proportions with several capital losses and more than 800 pilots involved.  
  
[![Capital Fleet Hit By a DoomsDay](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3108/capddthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3108%2Fcapdd.png) A capital fleet of at least 350 ships from Against All Autorities [AAA], Ushra Khan, Aggression [AGGRO] and Atlas Alliance have clashed against a similar sized force sporting (among the others) members of Red Alliance, Pandemic Legion [PL], Legion of xXDEATHXx [XIX], scorched earth, Tau Ceti and Goonswarm.  
  
Atlas and allies were trying to kill a starbase that was due out from reinforced mode. Blazin Hazin of Atlas Alliance recalls the moment the hell break loose: " _[we] went on the [starbase] with our capital fleet. [PL] came in with their dreads at snipe range on us, [XIX] came in close range. As [PL] came in, we jumped in [AAA] capitals on them close range … we won capital fight, but all Atlas support and [AGGRO] died_".  
  
As for the defending side, Critical Sniper of Red Alliance gave his view on the fight: " _The fight started when we jumped in - via titan - on Atlas' Caps. I guess then [XIX] and [PL] came with dreads and we got counter hot drop by [AAA] … [They] had about 100 Capitals, maybe more, our side had 60 or maybe less"._   
Sniper went on adding _: "_ _We held the field in the end but cap fight was lost … they destroyed 2 towers … but [new ones] are already stationed in the place._"

XIX and Allies, however, are sure the fight was not a definitive win for Atlas. El'rac of Scorched Earth explains: " _This was a major push to support our allies in Detorid and stop Atlas push to take high end moons in the area … [The] Fight was a success, our allies held the field._"  
  
Detorid War is now escalating to the size of a inter-regional Conflict, but It is still too soon to guess whether this is going to be a long attrition war or rather a quick blitzkriege scenario.  
  
Further updates will be published as soon as reports will became available.
