**Kanen** is a mid-level mining overseer on an [asteroid colony](6NQhah6uyVb1Bzg0ifUe5N). Though his superior wanted him gone
due to a past accident, the colony was short on people and needed to
retain him. He is viewed as bad luck after pile-driving a massive
operational piece of mining equipment into a group of people.
