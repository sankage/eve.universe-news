# Aritcio Kor-Azor
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/aritcio-kor-azor

**Aritcio Kor-Azor** is the reigning [Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) of
the [Kor-Azor Family](1S0FEGgzJiwc4yXaG5AzjD). He came to power in
YC105 following the ascension of his father,
Doriam Kor-Azor to the Imperial Throne.
Aritcio had long been the favored successor of his father, who refused
to believe anything bad about him. Many viewed his ascension to power
with dismay, rightly fearing Aritcio's tyrannical rule.

Youth
-----

Aritcio was well suited to political machinations, being known for
having a perfect mixture of charm, dishonesty, and paranoia. However, he
was not known to understand the plight of the common man, having been
brought up in sheltered luxury. This caused much tension in his realm,
as the populace was used to the benevolent rule of his father.

### Scandal on Eclipticum

Early in his reign as Heir, Aritcio was involved in controversy
following an "incident" at a cathedral on Eclipticum. The "incident"
resulted in the destruction of several holy artifacts, while a female
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) student involved in the "incident" had
to be returned to the Federation for medical treatment. Numerous Heirs,
including [Yonis Ardishapur](4Tb1Uk75SycuFuiizODkZD) and [Uriam Kador](7LJKelrqDXAAUYi6o48Uno) publicly displayed outrage at the
incident. Following the silence or disappearance of the witnesses,
Aritcio was cleared of wrongdoing by the Theology Council.

### Involvement in Crielere

Further controversy arose when Aritcio purchased two kidnapped
[Crielere](3Y34ZySL2hebLjco1Y25IK) scientists from the
[Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) for over a trillion ISK. Speculation and
fear spread rampantly about Aritcio's intentions while the
[Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) refused to take action against him.
Eventually, [President Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) stepped in
and began negotiations with Aritcio for the return of the scientists.
Aritcio eventually agreed to return them in exchange for trade and
mining rights in the Federation, a move that prompted the [Republic Parliament](2EcbNQu5ua4Jjt3TTM0CvW) to issue a statement of
concern.

However, it was revealed that the scientists were actually
slaves who had stolen the scientists' identities.
A manhunt was started for the scientists on Inix-Ilis I, the location of
the mine the slaves had escaped from. Aritcio demanded the slaves be
executed, but the Federation claimed they had been legally purchased and
freed them. The scientists were eventually discovered
[dead](5WNhh1Tm9Ucm0ni1HgOotc) in the mines, while the Amarrians began to
claim the slaves were actually rebel infiltrators who had made off with
sensitive documents.

### Apocalypse auction

Further criticism was levied at the Heir when it was revealed that an
Imperial Apocalypse being auctioned off by the BIG Lottery had once
belonged to Aritcio, who left it at a Gallente actress's estate
following a night of wild partying. Aritcio was spared further
embarrassment when the ship was returned to the Empire by the winners of
the lottery.

Later years
-----------

Aritcio became increasingly erratic and sadistic in his behavior as the
years went by. He became known for handing down harsh punishments to his
vassals for both real and imagined slights. He ordered a baby cut in
half, had a [Holder's](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) lips cut off after ordering an
end to previous punishments levied against, had a mime's tongue cut out
and fed to him without even hearing his case, put a man to death for
theft on the word of a strange personage only Aritcio had seen, had a
child tortured for flying a kite into the trees in the royal yard,
forced a woman to dance naked daily because she was beautiful, killed
the woman's husband for keeping her for himself, and thousands of other
acts described as atrocities. He found his own erratic behavior to be
quite amusing, often making quips to his religious and military advisors
between pronouncements

This behavior eventually led to his vassals on Liparer II to revolt
against his rule. The planet was saved from utter annihilation only by
the actions of [Brother Joshua](3GdUiafeRMQKdpzDb8CWnJ), a
[Speaker of Truths](3vA8Xh4A10DiybH2UTOEUO).

### House revolt and Speaker of Truths intervention

The situation finally came to a head when hundreds of Kor-Azor Holders
petitioned the Speakers of Truth to address their concerns against
Aritcio. Brother Joshua came to the Kor-Azor palace and issued a
judgment against Aritcio, bringing up an old religious law that allowed
an aggrieved party to demand a pound of flesh in restitution. While
Aritcio's status as an Heir reduced the severity of an individual claim
to virtual insignificance, the sheer number of claims against him would
have ended with his death.

Though Aritcio at first refused to hear the sentence, the Speaker
threatened to strike his name from the [Book of Records](5cxn8rCjeyzZ2Q4jZVH3zf), an act that would not only have
removed Aritcio's immunity from prosecution but also dethroned him and
stripped him of his royal rights. The threat compelled Aritcio's
military and religious advisers to figure out a compromise. Aritcio's
claimants would each get their restitution in blood, but only piecemeal.
Aritcio would be brought to the brink of death, then allowed to heal
with cellular regenerators. In this way, Aritcio was carved up time and
time again by ordinary scalpels, then regrown in a [cellular regenerator](4liwftCjzbWBQHTNJb5OXJ), all until all his victims
had received their piece of flesh

### Personality change

The dismemberment and regeneration of Aritcio had a profound affect on
the Heir. Following his recovery, his personality and outlook on life
changed radically, to the point where he became both benevolent and
kind. He generally began to rule in favor of the downtrodden and
oppressed, dedicating himself to bettering the lives of his subjects and
affording them all basic dignity and human rights. He also recruited a
number of people - all of whom, including [Alder Brenean](6PQrwejyL3BQeliI539SUz), he personally interviewed - to aid
him in ruling his domains in a humane and efficient way.

In addition, Aritcio made it a personal mission to travel around his
kingdom and learn about the people and allow them to learn about him, so
that he could ensure they all lived to the standards set by the Kor-Azor
House. In this mission - which also was intended to address the problems
the lesser Holders and commoners were having with their betters - he was
accompanied by a group of trusted servants, such as Alder, on whom he
relied for a commoner's perspective

### Example of secret philanthropy

While on a mission to one planet with an unusual and impenetrable
political setup, Aritcio discovered rising unrest among the commoners,
which stood in stark opposition to the lack of problems in regular
reports from the planetary governor. Aritcio realized that the political
entrenchment on the planet would make it difficult to simply enforce his
will on the political leaders, so he began a tour of the population.

The endeavor took several days, during which Aritcio gave speeches
during the day. It became apparent during this tour that the people did
not want him there, viewing him as a politician who spoke only empty
words and could offer no real change. Each day, once he had finished
with the speeches, Aritcio conducted a secret inspection of the planet.
At nights he would travel out among the populace in disguise and meet
with them personally. Despite Alder's reservations, Aritcio was never
once discovered.

One night, he returned bearing several injuries and burns. When offered
the services of a doctor, he turned it down, revealing a distrust of
medical professionals since his past punishment by Brother Joshua. The
next day, the news reported on a massive fire that was extinguished with
the assistance of volunteers. Despite Aritcio's presence, no mention of
any assisting strangers was reported. The night after, he had nightmares
which caused him to scream out; these were apparently recurring.

Eventually, Aritcio met with the planetary governor, with only Alder at
his side. Aritcio attempted to convince the governor to willingly
improve the conditions of the populace, but the governor adamantly
refused and persisted in insulting Aritcio and his efforts. Eventually,
Aritcio escorted Alder out of the room, then continued his meeting with
the governor in privacy. It is unknown what passed between them, but at
some point, Aritcio attacked the governor with a Khumaak and beat him to
death.

The murder was subsequently covered up, with false reports that the
governor had crashed into the ocean before ever reaching the meeting.
Aritcio announced plans to meet with the continental overseers, but they
in turn - having understood the message being sent by their lord -
announced plans to investigate and improve the living conditions of the
populace, and found themselves, to their explicit regret, entirely too
busy to meet with Aritcio.

Current Status
--------------

To the public, Aritcio appears to have been completely transformed by
his ordeal. He has scars, but he hides them well, and he has put his
strength of will and character - which had found a twisted release in
his past life, but had also kept him alive and reasonably sane during
the cleansing torture - to good use in a decent and honorable service to
his house and to the Empire at large.

In December YC110, Empress [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) appointed
Aritcio the new [Imperial Chancellor](7GOV3morIu47J3BmidrhU8).
