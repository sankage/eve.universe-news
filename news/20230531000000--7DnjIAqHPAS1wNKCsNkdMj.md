### Caldari Megacorporations Recall Extraterritorial Workers as New Rationing Comes Into Effect

New Caldari Prime – Following an agreement reached at yesterday’s meeting of the Chief Executive Panel (CEP), the “Big Eight” megacorporations of the Caldari State have all ordered a widescale repatriation of workers. Sent to extraterritorial stations and planetary habitats earlier today, the orders called for the reassignment to home territories of a significant number of non-essential workers with Caldari citizenship.

This mass worker recall coincides with the signing of a ration-ceiling agreement by all eight members of the CEP. This agreement introduces maximum limits on the purchasing of a wide variety of goods, both essentials and luxury commodities. These limits have been defined relative to an employee's corporate classification. The new limits will be enforced by standard corporate oversight of personal corporate scrip accounts, with all transactions being monitored and blocked should they exceed the ration-ceilings.

The combination of a mass labor repatriation with the expansion of rationing has many questioning the state of the Caldari economy. The Caldari State has long boasted one of New Eden’s strongest economies but was hit hardest by the Triglavian Invasions. Market analysts suspicious of these recent changes have been quick to point out that the State’s economy has generally been heavily reliant on foreign trade, with a higher proportion of trade being conducted outside its borders than by any other interstellar nation. Some theorize that the State may be starting to feel an economic pinch due to the heightened conflict with the Gallente Federation, rising tensions with the Amarr Empire, and relatively low trade activity from recently opened Minmatar markets.

Chairman Akimaka Saraki dismissed these fears at a press summit on New Caldari Prime, stating that: “The Caldari State is stronger now than it has ever been. As first in the cluster to finalize the construction of an Interstellar Shipcaster we have shown ourselves to be the masters of cutting-edge stellar transmuter and transport relay technology. These new measures have been implemented because we Caldari will do whatever it takes to ensure victory and prosperity. We call our citizens home so they might join us in the fight and strengthen the State. We bear the burden of rationing because we do not fear sacrifice. Let the people of the Federation grow complacent and fat, we shall see who endures the trials to come.”

Despite Chairman Saraki’s strong words there are growing rumors of unrest amongst lower-level workers. The classification banding included in the ration-ceiling agreement means that such citizens are under the tightest of the new restrictions. Many repatriated workers are leaving behind their families only to suffer greater State restrictions. Lower-classification citizens are also more likely to be reassigned to security services or conscripted into the State military. Clearly aware of such concerns, the CEP Chairman tackled them head on, saying, “All Caldari understand the values of Honor, Loyalty, and Duty. Only shirkers and traitors would refuse to do their part when called to service.”

### CONCORD Inner Circle Weighs Changes to New Eden Economic System as State Announces New Measures

Yulai, Genesis – Ongoing negotiations on interstellar economic, technology, and infrastructure regulations within CONCORD's Inner Circle have been dramatically shaken up by the Caldari State's announcement of new domestic rationing, financial monitoring, and worker repatriation measures.

While the State has been strongly arguing for further liberalization of interstellar trade and significant changes to empire taxation and SCC regulatory overheads, the recall of large numbers of employees, together with increased megacorporation controls and monitoring of consumption and expenditures has caused some disquiet among other delegates of the "Big 4" empires.

The Gallente Federation in particular has indicated its concern that the moves are a prelude to a more protectionist stance by the State, despite its pursuit of open markets for its own goods and services, or an attempt to unbalance the financial system by directing capital flows and investment disproportionately towards Caldari internal markets and industries. The Caldari State's negotiators have dismissed these fears as "misplaced attempts to reopen arguments already settled" at the summit. 

In contrast, the Amarr Empire has seized on the opportunity to improve its strained relations with the State by declaring that it views the new Caldari measures as "matters of internal economic organization and social reform". Despite the end of its formal military alliance with the State, the Greater Amarr Empire has maintained considerable trade links with Caldari megacorporations, in particular using its Khanid Kingdom and Ammatar Mandate vassal states to increase flows of exchange between the two powers.

So far the Minmatar Republic's delegation has preferred to keep its own counsel on the Caldari announcement, at least in private, and is concentrating on developing its own approach to reforming SCC taxes and overhauling the regulations and fees levied on capsuleer structures. Much agreement has been found between the Caldari and Minmatar on the topic of the Upwell Consortium's preferential status as a provider of industrial services. Both empires view the dominant position of the interstellar consortium with deep suspicion since the events of the Triglavian Invasions, its role in arming and funding EDENCOM, and the spate of industrial espionage scandals in recent years.

While the Amarr Empire is noted for having an ambiguous relationship with Upwell and EDENCOM, it has found common cause with the Gallente Federation's wish to normalize the structure of industrial fees and taxes, and it appears likely that some kind of deal on the overall industrial support servicing, taxation, and licensing regime  will be forged between the Big 4 empires.

Negotiations are ongoing and the precise package of new economic and technology regulations to come is expected within the next two weeks.
