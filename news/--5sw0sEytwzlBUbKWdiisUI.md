# Catiz Tash-Murkon
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/catiz-tash-murkon

Catiz Tash-Murkon, the youngest child of the late [Davit Tash-Murkon](2oZy0VaNvw0heNN5Pojumk), is the leader of the [Tash-Murkon](4t1KEOTA8LvYIHDcOtIPAb) [royal house](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh), and the most wealthy person in the [Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo).

It came as little surprise when Davit named her as his heir. When she was still in her teens she refused to follow the safe, boring and restricting path her siblings took in the upper echelons of [Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) society. Instead, she headed out on her own as a lone miner, starting her own business without any help from her family. She was determined that what she built would be hers and hers alone, and eventually she developed her venture into one of the successful business empires in the Empire.

After her father's [ritual death](7uCmeRGL3bgVWlEWQ9TZQb) on losing the [succession trials](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx), Catiz returned to her house, merging her own business interests with those of her father's. With this combination came formidable economical power, resulting in one of the most powerful business empires in the Empire.

Many of the more progressive Amarr Holders look to Catiz and the Tash-Murkon family as models for the economic future of the Empire. However, because she is [Udorian](723tMHRDvyldo15RMLMuqh), many conservatives dislike her. Generally, people are already jokingly saying that when Catiz sneezes the whole empire quivers. This is not far from the truth and many now anxiously wait to see how Catiz will wield her power. Few believe that becoming the richest person in the empire suffices to quench her burning ambitions.
