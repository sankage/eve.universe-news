Wormhole Cults, Minmatar Unity, and Caldari Settlements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The continuing impact of the
cluster-wide emergence of wormholes on [New
Eden's](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) populace was reflected in early
April with reports of multiple 'wormhole cults' spreading throughout the
empires. Varying from [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) heterodox and schismatic
sects to [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) radical nature-worship cults,
the many hundreds of groups springing up in response to the wormholes
appeared entirely spontaneous and unconnected to one another.

Despite mixed reactions among the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) and [Thukker Tribe](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z) populations regarding the union of the
Thukker with the Republic, the overall response to the development
appeared to be quietly positive. In particular, the Thukker were
impressed by the swift and decisive action of
[Sanmatar](180IYq6xQy0PzfGH6hLEuO) [Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV) over
the missing, and subsequently lost, Lakat-Hro Great Caravan. Even so,
many Thukker voices emphasized that their traditional autonomy had to be
maintained at all costs.

The successes of the Caldari offensive in the militia warfare zone
covering Black Rise and neighboring regions appeared to be emboldening
large numbers of Caldari to settle in the newly-opened region. A [House of Records](6JvE4aPaJ3FcJ1dZPhFfES) report showed that the numbers
of colonists moving to Black Rise had more than doubled in the first
months of the year. With megacorporations such as
[Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK) and [Lai Dai Corporation](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT) committed to large-scale projects,
and a myriad independent ventures springing up in their wake, the
Caldari spirit of expansion seemed in full flow. In contrast to this,
the [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) was forced into a
humiliating cancellation of its "search and recovery" mission in [Black Rise](black-rise), terminating "Operation Justice's Reach" in
a response to the reality of Caldari occupations and continuing gains in
the Verge Vendor and Placid regions.

Ishukone Succession Decided
---------------------------

With Ishukone stock having fallen sharply
at the end of March, apparently due to investor concerns over perceived
indecision regarding the appointment of a new CEO, the matter of the
leadership of Ishukone Corporation became urgent in April. One sign of
the interest taken in the matter by State Executor [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG) was the meeting held between Haatakan
Oiritsuu, former Kaalakiota CEO and special envoy for Heth, and Soisonen
Okalala, the [Minedrill](2cjgnHBuWiKY7pH2xjzvG0) CEO contending for the
[Ishukone](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) CEO position with Mens
Reppola of [Ishukone Watch](21GQBhNgawJQQ39wqVX4yU). Some days later,
Okalala visited the Landfall Shrine on New Caldari and spoke about the
issues concerning Ishukone. He was also able to declare that the
Ishukone board had informed him and other Ishukone subsidiary CEOs that
a decision on the megacorporation CEO spot would come "within the next
two weeks."

With the contest between Okalala and Reppola stepping up a gear, a major
panic was caused by the sudden collapse of Ishukone board member Natasha
Ogemi at her home. The news of Ogemi's collapse sparked a rush to sell
Ishukone stock as investors panicked, presumably believing that the
Ishukone CEO appointment process would be further delayed. The Ishukone
board responded by calling an emergency meeting at the Malkalen
headquarters of the megacorporation the following day. Mens Reppola and
Soisonen Okalala were called to the meeting amid speculation that the
board was to act decisively to appoint a new CEO. Reppola announced that
he had personally purchased a five percent stake in Ishukone before
leaving for the meeting. As Ishukone stock once more rebounded,
Reppola's enormous personal investment appeared to be his final move in
the contest for the CEO position.

Hours later, after the emergency board meeting, Mens Reppola emerged as
the new CEO of the Ishukone Corporation. The Ishukone Watch CEO
succeeded to the post with all board members voting in his favor,
including Natasha Ogemi from her hospital bed. Reppola pledged to steer
Ishukone on a course honoring 'the legacy of Otri Gariushi.' He
emphasised the strong culture of innovation and technological
development at Ishukone, while also pledging to seek new markets and
abandon protectionism. Reppola also called on the Ishukone board to
encourage employee investment in the megacorporation and release
two-thirds of the shares under board control for purchase by Ishukone
workers. His declared vision was one of corporate citizenship and stock
ownership going hand-in-hand.

The reaction of State Executor Tibus Heth to the appointment of Mens
Reppola as Ishukone CEO remained unknown with a distinctly muted
reaction from the Caldari Providence
Directorate. However, the
Provists also had to contend with mixed reactions, and some opposition,
to their planned military reforms. Set against a background of large
costs from occupying [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i), the
reform plans aimed at further modernizing the [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) and Army while centralizing the military
chain of command. The Patriot bloc corporations were quick to back the
plan, most notably the dynamic Lai Dai Corporation, but indications of
Practical faction opposition caused some concern to the CPD. The
opposition of the Liberal megacorporations, Ishukone and Hyasyoda, was
expected but with Practicals unenthusiastic it seemed as if the reforms
could be watered down or even blocked.

Empire and Mandate
------------------

In the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo), the [Imperial Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g)
announced its decision to withdraw from W-space exploration, citing a
lack of immediate threat and declaring the wormholes to be a matter of
scientific interest rather than military concern. The Navy went on to
urge loyalist capsuleers to continue exploration efforts on behalf of
the Empire. Cynics might have observed that the Imperial Navy had taken
unknown losses in its encounters with [Sleeper Drones](sleepers) in W-space and was simply choosing
to offload dangerous and costly work onto capsuleer paramilitaries.
However, in the Amarr Empire at least, such thoughts went unspoken.

Meanwhile, in the [Ammatar Mandate](4BV4ldw5RdVB4FxKctn4J6), the
[Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) announced a major
package of aid and reconstruction to be implemented in the Derelik
region. The multi-trillon ISK package, announced by Ardishapur finance
cheif Adreyi Ezion, aimed to 'bring the region up to par with other
regions of the Empire in terms of piety, learning, health and economy.'
Commentators suggested that the package was probably the largest ever
initiated in the Empire in terms of its scope and financial backing. The
desire of [Yonis Ardishapur](4Tb1Uk75SycuFuiizODkZD) to transform
the Mandate from a neglected fringe province to a 'vital node' of the
Empire seemed clear.
