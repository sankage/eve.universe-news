Pimbeka - The infamous Order of St. Tetrimon today issued forth a short statement emanating from Khanid space. Read by Grand Master Horm, the statement welcomed Jamyl Sarum home and went on to say "God's children rejoice as His light returns home, and the light shall bring death and despair on His enemies." 

Nothing more was forthcoming.
