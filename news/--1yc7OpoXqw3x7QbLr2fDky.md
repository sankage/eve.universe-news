**Antel** was a worker in forge/mining complex somewhere in [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) space. He agreed to join a labor uprising at the behest of his friend [Foraani](tbYpm3sMEm2CR2xZzkfoH), but had a change of heart and attempted to report the uprising to a guard. The guard turned out to be part of the conspiracy and executed Antel on the spot.
