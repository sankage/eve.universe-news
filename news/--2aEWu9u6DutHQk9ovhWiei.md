**Gerets** is a member of the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) armed forces, he was the only survivor when his barracks on [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i) was hit by orbital bombardment. He was so disfigured they had to use RNA scans to confirm his identity. His face looks like a child's drawing of a man that had been smudged with water and grime and the crumpled into a ball and flattened back out. Though his appearance can be fixed, he is more useful to the military as a symbol of perseverance and strength in the face of stark brutal reality and so, while they will give him the money to fix his appearance, they intend to drag it out for a long time. He is described as bright, morose, and scarred mentally. He is engaged to [Braea](1zGyRkgv0bdNXjHFbw58ZO).
