# Prisoner Cargo Vehicle
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/prisoner-cargo-vehicle

A **prisoner cargo vehicle**, as the name indicates, is a type of ground
transport used to ferry prisoners between secure locations.

A notable example is the "Bertha", a large prisoner cargo vehicle in use
by the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) on at least one of their secure
(and secret) prisons. It has thick tires and large doors and is capable
of transporting a large number of prisoners at once over unforgiving and
hot terrain.
