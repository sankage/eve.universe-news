Gyt Quisog, the Jovian official supervising the collection of the body parts of Misu Baniya, announced during a session in the Inner Circle of CONCORD yesterday that enough body parts had been collected for a reconstruction of the unfortunate liaison to be viable. Quisog again thanked all those involved in making this possible; the empires for organizing the collection and pilots everywhere for their enthusiastic contribution.   
  
Now that the reconstruction effort is underway, the Jovians feel itâ€™s time to own up to their end of the bargain, with the gift of blueprint copies. These are blueprints for an advanced cloaking device not yet available to the general public and will undoubtedly come in handy for the recipients and their friends. Quisog promised that those pilots due a blueprint will receive their gift in the next 24 hours or so.   
  
The announcement met with great approval and satisfaction from the assembled CONCORD members, who were greatly impressed by the cooperation and camaraderie shown by the participants during the collection. Many expressed their hope that this was just the first instance of many where pilots from all the races and all the factions could come and work together for the benefit of the whole of mankind.
