# Gorda Hoje
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/gorda-hoje

Gorda Hoje was a [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) philanthropist who died
over three centuries ago. Hoje was a novelty in his time and age, and
his works, which ranged from cryptic philosophical texts to meticulous
science papers, were generally regarded as too eccentric and absurd to
have any real value. In his lifetime, Hoje acted as a mentor to many of
the greatest Jovian minds of the younger generation, among them Ior Labron, the founder of the [Society of Conscious Thought](5dFqRGejzFToa1MwNTN1G1). After Hoje's death,
his followers started to promote his works in earnest and Hoje is today
regarded as one of the most profound and influential of Jove
intellectuals.
