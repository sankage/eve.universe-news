# Year YC106
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/year-yc106

January
-------

January proved a difficult month for [House Kor-Azor](1S0FEGgzJiwc4yXaG5AzjD): [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV), head of the family and son of
[Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) [Doriam II](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT),
was reported as having been involved in an 'incident' in the [Cathedral of St. Tal-Romon](sQa3CgriPhcdRyu5wArOb) on the planet of
Eclipticum in the [Kor-Azor Prime](62Qsy38P0XnR1c2JhWHzFq) system.
Apparently having rented the cathedral for private commemoration of
"religious festivities," the [Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) was
deep in 'celebration' with a number of cronies when a priest of the
cathedral walked in on the group.

As it emerged that a number of artifacts had been destroyed, that the
cathedral had had to be thoroughly cleansed and that portions of it had
needed to be re-sanctified, [Yonis Ardishapur](4Tb1Uk75SycuFuiizODkZD), head of the devout [House Ardishapur](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO), voiced his concerns over the
incident and demanded that the [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) investigate. Seemingly oblivious
of (or simply uncaring toward) the controversy he had sparked, Aritcio
was soon celebrating his ninety-ninth birthday in lavish style,
prompting [Uriam Kador](7LJKelrqDXAAUYi6o48Uno), head of [Kador Family](3ium7VluTCFnGS0TqpinlO), to denounce the Emperor's son as an
'uncouth scoundrel.' Whatever the opinion of his peers, Aritcio seemed
to have the better of the matter when the Theology Council cleared him
of any wrongdoing concerning the cathedral.

The [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)-[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) research
effort at the [Crielere](3Y34ZySL2hebLjco1Y25IK) Project ran into trouble
when Crielere command staff confirmed that a number of advanced
technology [blueprints](2jdWyizy6WC4rfbjC7px6T) had been stolen.
[Otro Gariushi](5QydCJCoYvbvbWvFlAlbHg), charismatic CEO of the
[Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) (a major partner
in Crielere), played down the matter, declaring it insignificant
compared to the advances made by the project. Even so, Gallente
Federation [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E) [Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) made a surprise visit to the
Crielere research facilities. Letting it be known that he was extremely
displeased with the way the Crielere command had handled the theft,
Foiritan insisted that an exhaustive investigation be
conducted.

No doubt anticipating that such an investigation would uncover
inconvenient facts, Otro Gariushi seems to have decided to tackle the
matter head-on. Declaring that the Caldari had 'carried' the Crielere
Project, disparaging Gallente contributions, Gariushi all but admitted
that the Caldari had taken the missing blueprints, justifying the act as
compensation for their own contribution. Unsurprisingly, these remarks
caused an uproar among the Gallente scientific establishment and
outraged the Gallente Federation, with the [Senate](x8brOPuT22Bcly2Sikkt5)
immediately suspending funding to the Crielere Project. Attempting to
calm the situation, the leading scientists on the project, Gallentean
Henric Touvolle and Caldari [Taromi Umailen](DIS7xhmJ6Kk5JwiEh9uZ1),
publicly called for harmony, asking their fellow scientists to stay with
the Crielere research community.

As the greatest research project ever seen in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) was wracked with problems,
[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) had to deal with an apparent rogue
officer. A taskforce of CONCORD ships was sighted leaving secure space
without authorization by [DED](1xZoOUsqaDhJw7gQffHMFC) Command. So seriously was
the matter taken that an emergency session of the CONCORD Assembly was
called. Within days, DED Internal Security Chief Tantoseisen Kakkichi
turned himself in, returning his task force to CONCORD-patrolled space.
The affair took a curious turn when the imprisoned DED officer was
placed under a gag order, along with his legal team, as CONCORD fleet
activity was seen to rise sharply.

February
--------

The inevitable happened in February, with the Caldari State and the
Gallente Federation officially abandoning the Crielere project and the
research stations they had constructed in the Crielere system. A
[Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) raid seeking to capitalize on the
situation was foiled by a hundreds-strong
[capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) force gathered to defend the
scientists after warnings came in of Guristas reconnoitering the
stations. After a second attempt to raid the stations amid evacuations
proceedings, the Guristas retreated entirely from Crielere. Perhaps in
gratitude, but likely mainly out of principle, the Crielere scientists
chose to publicize their findings, leading to several advanced
technologies reaching the open market.

On a later run intended to reverse some of their setbacks in Crielere, The Guristas
were dealt a huge blow when [Jirai 'Fatal' Laitanen](2cUo2UbsCruVr7VsIHmw1N) was killed in battle, even as
[Korako 'The Rabbit' Kosakami](3Mb6UfjhKf0MdSbbR4a2EU) escaped. The
two Guristas leaders led a strike force against the Crielere Project
where they succeeded in capturing lead scientists Henric Touvolle and
Taromi Umailen. Kosakami was able to take the abducted scientists with
him when he made good his escape. For a time, it was thought that the
Guristas organization had been thrown into complete disarray by the
death of one of their founders, but seasoned observers still today
suspect this was all a ploy, with Laitanen, a veteran capsuleer, almost
certainly alive and in hiding.

CONCORD stunned New Eden by announcing they had discovered a series of
abandoned deep space bases throughout the outer regions of the cluster.
Treason charges against Commander Tantoseisen Kakkichi were being
dropped in light of his instrumental role in discovering the mysterious
network of bases, 69 in total, spread across 23 regions. CONCORD
investigation teams had established that the bases were perhaps 20 years
old, possibly older, and constructed by an organization known only as
'Immensea.' Amazing as this news was, it was not the only discovery
CONCORD made in the outer regions in February, as they later released
details of a network of uncharted [stargates](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk),
believed to be linked to the Immensea organization and extensively used
by pirates and smugglers.

The [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) found itself convulsed by a
debate over the public display of the Khumaak, a symbol of freedom for
the Minmatar ever since a rebellion was sparked by an [Ardishapur Heir's](17tWRlpXtkWqoUBdAdWGxN) death at the hands of a slave
wielding the Heir's own traditional Amarr sunburst scepter \- the very
object later idealized as the Khumaak. As Prime Minister [Karin Midular's](3KxlNVAeglPj5ZH0sf3U2j) [Sebiestor Tribe](1fNour0sFTIcCFRVQM2pro) pushed for the symbol to be removed
from the list of official state symbols and banned from public display
at state occasions, other tribes vigorously opposed the measure.

March
-----

In March the Khumaak issue came to a head, with the [Republic Parliament](2EcbNQu5ua4Jjt3TTM0CvW) eventually adopting a compromise measure providing for the symbol to remain sanctioned for
display on fleet, military and state apparel but banned from display at
state occasions, particularly those involving contact with
representatives of the Amarr Empire. In general, the entire move to ban
the Khumaak was felt to have backfired, as it started a widely-adopted
fashion of wearing the object among Minmatar in the Republic.

Tragically, the scientists Henric Touvolle and Taromi Umailen were found to have died of starvation
in the [slave mines](6NQhah6uyVb1Bzg0ifUe5N) of the Amarr planet
Inis-Ilix I. Despite an earlier agreement between \[Aritcio Kor-Azor and
President Souro Foiritan that the scientists would be freed, a terrible
mix-up - possibly caused by freedom-seeking
[slaves](slavery) - resulted in the scientists' being sent
to one of the brutal mines run by House Kor-Azor. It was rumored that
the slaves who'd used the mix-up to escape had carried sensitive
documents out of Aritcio Kor-Azor's research facilities.

The Ishukone Corporation was once more embroiled in controversy when it
emerged that a multi-billion ISK deal to supply the [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj) with transcranial microcontrollers
was intended to facilitate the devices' use on slaves. As adverse
comment erupted across New Eden, the Khanid Kingdom emphatically denied
ill treatment of slaves fitted with the microcontrollers, giving
examples of slaves voluntarily lining up to be implanted with the
devices. Ishukone CEO Otro Gariushi was also moved to defend the
practice, claiming the microcontrollers improved quality of life for the
slaves. The CONCORD Inner Circle's later ruling that the trade was legal
dissatisfied many, but the chips continued streaming to the Khanid
Kingdom unabated.

The [Quafe Company](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6), the enormous Gallente
soft drink conglomerate, hit the headlines with aggressive promotion of
its products, in particular its new soft drink Quafe Ultra! Despite
Caldari complaints, the Quafe Corporation pressed on with its marketing
strategy, promoting the drink across foreign markets and commissioning a
holoreel named 'Ultra!' to promote the new drink. The premiere of
'Ultra!' was a smash box-office success, and a party for the stars and
other dignitaries was announced.

Tragedy was to strike at the party, held at the Rent-A-Dream Gardens in
Elarel system, when a terrorist organization named UDI (United against
Decadence and Impurity) raided the facilities, killing several of the
film's stars along with other party guests. Narrowly missing an
opportunity to assassinate President Souro Foiritan, who was invited
late to the party, the UDI nevertheless shocked New Eden. The incident
became known as the 'Elarel Massacre.'

April
-----

April opened with Gallente Federation President Souro Foiritan pledging
to bring the UDI to justice and setting up a special investigative task
force. Within days the Federal Intelligence Office was able to claim
results when it captured a UDI operative in the Sinq Laison region.
President Foiritan addressed the Federation, confirming the capture and
calling for increased vigilance.

Transcranial microcontrollers were back in the headlines as demand for the devices in
the Gallente Federation sent prices spiking. Such was the price increase
that the Khanid Kingdom broke off its import contract with Ishukone
Corporation, citing the increased cost of the chips, which had risen in
line with market conditions. In a bizarre turn, the prevalence of
microcontrollers as recreational devices in the Federation was
highlighted by the antics of Gallente Senator Cedriq Tyrion, who behaved
as if he were dallying with a young girl in the middle of a speech to
the Senate. The strange behavior was caused by the influence of a
transcranial microcontroller over Senator Tyrion and the incident raised
Gallente concerns about the devices' ancillary effects.

May
---

Plans for the restoration of the damaged St. Tal-Romon Cathedral on
Eclipticum, site of the controversial incident involving Aritcio
Kor-Azor, were initially raised by [Catiz Tash-Murkon](5sw0sEytwzlBUbKWdiisUI), but in May Emperor [Doriam II](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT) himself took a personal interest, declaring
the cathedral to be the property of the Imperial Throne. In his decree,
the Emperor ordered that the cathedral be moved stone-by-stone to [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4) and reconstructed on holy ground on the
[Amarr home continent](4wZzhhUMIfR4ziHGaMOiLJ).

A rare initiative from the Jovian Directorate started off one of the more unusual incidents of the year.
Announcing that Misu Baniya, a [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) ambassador, would
be a diplomatic liaison with the four major empires and other factions,
the Jove amazed New Eden by declaring that their representative would
visit all the faction leaders in the space of one hour. With the method
for achieving this miracle discovered to be a matter transmission
device, amazement turned to horror when the device malfunctioned,
scattering the Jove ambassador across the cluster in tens of thousands
of pieces.

In the aftermath, [Tunai Moran](2ZZWIuISJ1CkxQjKLjp8Xf), Jove Ambassador
to the CONCORD Assembly, revealed that Misu Baniya's brainscan had not
been completed before his disintegration, resulting in a faulty
[clone](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o) activation. The four empires swiftly offered
to assist the Jovian Directorate when it was made clear that the Jove
possessed the means to reconstruct Misu Baniya if sufficient fragments
of his body could be recovered. It was soon discovered that tiny pieces
of Baniya had appeared on stations across the New Eden cluster and the
empires began to buy the Jove body parts on the market.

The [Secure Commerce Commission](53xiV87Fsc331zU35qelSd)
stepped in within days, placing a moratorium on the trade in Jove body
parts on the grounds of the distortions being created in the market by
massive infusions of ISK from the empires. Black market trading in
fragments of the unfortunate Baniya rose sharply following the SCC
moratorium. Ambassador Tunai Moran took the unusual step of offering
advanced cloaking technology [|blueprints](2jdWyizy6WC4rfbjC7px6T)
to encourage recovery of Baniya fragments. Shortly thereafter the SCC
lifted its moratorium. In a final twist, sources within the [Blood Raider](7obiU8rOyJkPZ3S0Faxc5W) Covenant revealed that [Omir Sarikusa](6UYaNpBPqY1ls1ps78PPPt), leader of the Blood Raiders, had
given orders to collect Jove body parts for unknown purposes.

June
----

Whatever scheme Omir Sarikusa was embarked on, he called a halt to Blood
Raider acquisitions of fragments of Misu Baniya at the beginning of
June, with a sizable portion of the luckless Jove's body collected and
reportedly made ready for transport at his personal base. Over the
course of the frenzied collecting operation hundreds of Blood Raider
vessels had been lost and speculation as to Sarikusa's need for the body
parts was intense.

The official collecting efforts of the empires culminated with direct
trading for the body parts by authorized buyback commissioners. With
Jove convoys running under cloak gathering the parts, the process was
completed within 24 hours of the buyback beginning. The Jove official
supervising the collection, Gyt Quisog, was later able to confirm to
CONCORD's Inner Circle that sufficient body parts had been collected to
make reconstruction viable. Cloaking technology blueprints would duly be
made available to pilots participating in the collection effort. By the
end of the month, the Jove Directorate was able to announce the
successful molecular reconstruction of Misu Baniya and a conventional
diplomatic tour by the restored Jove ambassador.

July
----

July saw the completion of the transfer of the Cathedral of St.
Tal-Romon from the planet Eclipticum in Kor-Azor Prime to Amarr, a
process which had begun the month before. With few transport losses
during the lengthy transfer process, the cathedral was expected to be
reconstructed and renovated without difficulty on the Amarr home
continent.

[Mordu's Legion](5csCeDqUe1exvVyfPdL75Q) saw much action during the
last half of the month, following a meeting between Muriya Mordu and
[Outer Ring Excavations](vtyIqELC7ngvFuWla7baP) CEO Orion
Mashel. An extensive mobilization of Legionforces led up to a major
strike against [Serpentis](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs) Prime, where Muriya
Mordu used an unknown device on the primary chemical refinery station
orbiting Serpentis Prime VIII. Speculation about the device ranged from
its being everything from a sabotage weapon to an advanced scanning
system.

August
------

Whatever the case, Mordu's task force moved cautiously through the
now-alerted Serpentis territories before being pinned down in August by
[Guardian Angels](13iuE2XufxAu060NRm4hhd) forces led by Brynn
Jerdola and Setele Schellan, noted commanders in the [Angel Cartel](3p6aB4GMbVdMUEVYOb3kF0) force tasked with protecting their
Serpentis ally's assets. After an hour-long battle, the Guardians were
forced to retreat and await reinforcements, allowing the canny Muriya
Mordu to withdraw his forces in good order, escaping for friendlier
space with his mysterious task completed.

September
---------

Announced the previous month, the COLOSSUS race qualifiers opened in September, with
the Caldari Gaming Commission overseeing
[races](2ryywB98oyDuraCpSPpxqE) across the lawless regions of New
Eden. The [Lai Dai Corporation](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT) team was selected
after a thrilling race through Venal, while
[Wiyrkomi's](66psXtrftjRzA7MyKHtb7K) team was selected
following races through Catch.
[Kaalakiota's](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK) qualifiers ran through
Venal again, and Catch and Curse played host to the
[Nugoeihuvi](4Ykng1Buej1uH3Sy5ln3jW) selection race. The
Caldari Gaming Commission ran further races through the following weeks,
allowing the megacorporations to build up substantial teams of capsuleer
racers.

Constitutional change in the Gallente Federation was the major news
story of this month and the following, as President Souro Foiritan
battled to push through an amendment to the federal constitution
allowing him to run for president a second time when his first term
expired. Under the then-existing constitution it was mandated that only
a single term of five years as Federation President could be served.
With Souro Foiritan considering it vital to see through several of his
initiatives and deeming it necessary to serve another term, the Senate
played host to a stormy session as he put forward his proposal for
change. Senator [Mentas Blaque](1bZzUGejHEhyHp6LVUtjBT) emerged as his
leading opponent, with opposition to Foiritan succeeding in forcing a
compromise measure and referring the issue to an independent committee
of legal experts.

While Foiritan and Blaque clashed repeatedly in the media, the
constitutional committee diligently carried out its work and finally
concluded that the matter had to be decided in a Federation-wide
referendum. Voting booths opened across the Federation as the month came
to a close, with a high turn-out expected.

October
-------

As the referendum vote was counted, under the scrutiny of the
independent committee, unofficial polls at the beginning of October had
the electorate rejecting the Foiritan proposal and denying the incumbent
President the opportunity to run again for the highest office. As it
turned out, however, the official result showed a close vote accepting
the constitutional change and the federal constitution was duly amended.
Unwilling to let the matter rest there, Senator Blaque organized Souro
Foirita's opponents into a formidable force within the Federation
Senate. Tabling a no-confidence vote, the opposition succeeded in
persuading the Senate to pass it and force new Presidential elections.

With President Souro Foiritan continuing to hold office in the interim,
three candidates for the new elections emerged: the incumbent, Senator
Mentas Blaque and the humanitarian and diplomat Eman Autrech. Even at
this early stage campaigning became heated, with Blaque and Foiritan in
particular clashing.

November
--------

The big news in November was the
announcement by Outer Ring Excavations that it intended to release its
moon mining equipment and components for the construction of deep-space
starbases on the open market, much to the consternation of the four core
empires. Delegations from the empires were soon sent to meet with ORE
CEO Orion Mashel, in an attempt to persuade him not to proceed with
marketing such equipment to independent capsuleers. Finding him unmoved
by their negotiations, the Caldari State and Amarr Empire resorted to
threatening sanctions against ORE. This sparked a backlash from many
corporations and interested parties across New Eden, with suits and
claims filed against the two empires.

As the controversy over starbase construction raged, leaks from
CONCORD's Inner Circle revealed that large infestations of [rogue drones](3Krc0xwkty10ryEG5apWhG) had been discovered across empire
space. CONCORD\]was soon forced to confirm the authenticity of the leaks
and admitted it had been trying to contain this information, along with
the knowledge that new breeds of rogue drones had been found in
deadspace pockets across patrolled space.

Moving swiftly, CONCORD enlisted the empires in ruthless sweeps through
the worst drone infestations, within a matter of days successfully
neutralizing the threat of a widespread rogue drone breakout. Having
received warp beacon access to hundreds of deadspace pockets, the
empires declared their intention to use the pockets exclusively for
their own purposes and deny access to other parties. The New
[25ers](3XtdtI2Z8UIELt1J3aaGsh) group immediately protested in an attempt to
fight the monopoly being established by the empires, but it was a
17-year old Gallente girl that ended up thwarting their ambitions.
Hacking the warp beacon signal almost by accident, the girl released her
discovery to the world at large, rendering any attempt to restrict
access to the pockets impossible.

The starbase construction controversy had been rumbling on throughout
the month but was essentially stopped in its tracks when the CONCORD
Assembly made a revolutionary statement of recognition toward capsuleer
alliances. Confirming that its SCC division would not be restricting
sale of moon mining equipment to the factions now legally recognized by
the Assembly, CONCORD made the question of the alliances' legitimate use
of moon mining equipment and starbases a moot one.

December
--------

As many an empire interest peered forlornly into the future following
their defeat over the starbase issue, in a seemingly contradictory move
CONCORD chose to warn of the dangers of rising capsuleer idolatry in
December. As a conclusion to the year YC106, it was a somewhat curious
note of warning about the very danger CONCORD itself may have done much
to unleash. For the first time, the capsuleers were free to build their
own empires in earnest.
