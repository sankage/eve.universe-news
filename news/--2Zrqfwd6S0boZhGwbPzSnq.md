# Sefrim
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/sefrim

The **sefrim** (singular form sef) are a possibly-mythological race of
beings that visited the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) people more than 6000
years ago.

Appearance
----------

They are described as tall and angelically beautiful. They wore white
and amber robes and masks of gold and silver to protect the people from
being struck dead by the sight of them. The sefrim are mainly described
in Chapter I of the Epitoth in the [Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp),
and have fascinated scholars for centuries.

Activity
--------

They gave Emperor [Amash-Akura](4tm7IOIn0xaGeNFQcRl0Lc) the [Ametat and Avetat](3xzaFUZ92kHBMX7jIybldm). They dwelled in a building made
of marble, stayed by the Emperor's side during the day, and guarded him
while he slept. During their presence, the Empire suffered no disasters.

Departure from Amarr
--------------------

[Molok the Deceiver](2RdbRSnuNB033jTKtf12fV) turned the people
against them, so Amash-Akura cast them out. With them gone, Amash-Akura
rapidly aged.
