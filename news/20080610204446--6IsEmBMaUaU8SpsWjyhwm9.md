Vard – In an apparent snub of CONCORD’s bounty offer, the Republic Fleet refused to attack Elder warships as they retreated through Minmatar space. Thousands of Elder warships passed through stargates and jump portals towards the general direction of the Great Wildlands while Republic Fleet warships continued to patrol the Amarr border. Most of the Elder warships displayed signs of extended battle damage. 

Unconfirmed reports place the number of slaves rescued by the Elders in the "tens of millions", and that the entirety of the Starkmanir population in the Derelik Region was recovered.
