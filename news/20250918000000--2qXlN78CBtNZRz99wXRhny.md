### Mordu’s Legion Moves Against the Vanguard
Vanguard operatives have been deployed across the cluster, disrupting Upwell operations. In response, Mordu’s Legion has unleashed an unprecedented number of ground troops. These troops include new specialists specifically trained to counter the Vanguard.

The goal of the Vanguard remains unclear, though there are reports of them executing mercenary activities on the behalf of unknown third parties. These contracts seem to disrupt or exploit Upwell operations. Upwell representatives have accused the Deathless Circle of trying to steal proprietary technology. The Circle has repeatedly targeted Upwell, not only through the deployment of Vanguard, but also with Mercenary Dens. They are also suspected of involvement with the security virus that infected Skyhooks earlier this year.

Vanguard deployments are also being further weaponized against Upwell beyond the conflict ongoing on the ground. Thanks to intel gathered through Vanguard deployments, Upwell convoys have been exposed and targeted by capsuleers. The convoys in question were not registered with local authorities nor were they included in Upwell transport manifests. The consortium has declined to comment on why these convoys were unlisted or what their purpose is.

The Upwell Consortium board has, however, issued a statement of total confidence in Mordu’s Legion and their counteroffensive. They state that “we have no doubt that Muryia Mordu and the forces at his command will be able to return Consortium operations to normal in a timely fashion.” The statement went on to raise concerns over “the unchecked insidious influence of the Deathless Circle” and suggested that “the Consortium has been forced to police its own operations, unsupported by supposed law enforcement institutions.”

CONCORD and its representatives declined to respond to this comment directly, but their enforcement arm, the DED, has told the Scope that they “take all criminal activity very seriously, but are not accountable for policing regions beyond our jurisdiction. We are not able to comment on ongoing operations, but we assure the people of New Eden that both CONCORD and the DED are not blind to the threat posed by the Deathless Circle and their agents.”

### Anoikis Mapping Project Celebrates 100% Coverage
The Anoikis Mapping Project, a research endeavor funded by capsuleer Rhysio Typho, has been honored by the Federation for its contributions to science and exploration. In November of YC125, the corporation became the first institution to simultaneously place an operative in every one of the 2,604 systems within the Anoikis wormhole network. 

The Anoikis Mapping Project represents the broadest range of cosmic research data ever gathered from beyond the limits of New Eden. President Celes Aguard herself spoke at the event honoring the corporation, calling the project an “unparalleled achievement,” going on to say that “the bold attitude and uncompromised vision of these dedicated citizens is an example to us all.”

Since failing to occupy a Drifter wormhole system, the Federation has been looking for means to catch up with the other three major nations in the field of wormhole research. President Aguard herself has come under direct criticism from all sides of the political spectrum for this failure, as well as her decision to delay elections in order to focus on the now resolved Drifter Crisis.

When asked how she felt about President Aguard’s perceived failure to secure a place for the Federation within the Drifter wormhole systems, Rhysio responded, “In hard times, difficult decisions must be made. I am here to celebrate scientific achievement, not to judge whether other decisions would have been better. I am sure the President did what she judged to be best for all citizens of the federation."
