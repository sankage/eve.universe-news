# Isogen-5 Abaddon
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/isogen-5-abaddon

An unnamed **Abaddon** carrying a load of Isogen-5 was glimpsed at one
point prior to a galactic cataclysm. Even though this ship had the
ability to cloak, its unique signature was followed from the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o)
where its signal was first recorded during
the events that transpired during the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)/[Elder Fleet](7JAFwYwGqzvPv7yLIDlfjp) battle.

An enterprising [Sisters of EVE](77ihwsVRHRojCaPC5XZn2g) ship
followed it to [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L)'s private court and
then to a gigantic [rogue drone](3Krc0xwkty10ryEG5apWhG) hive, where it
appeared to be protected by the drones which were also harvesting
[Isogen-5](GUfs25YXqAoOPkb0XiE3i). The ship appeared to have been modified
so that it was almost all one mechanism with release ports, and the
front as part of some type of particle emitter . A large cache of
Isogen-5 on-board would indicate the Isogen-5 was either fuel or
ammunition.
