# Galen Doradoux
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/galen-doradoux

**Galen Doradoux** is a [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ). At one point he was in negotiations with members of the Vaarkota cartel in the [Xygia](3il5i5TcVobmo5ABWlm13q) system. The negotiations turned sour and Galen was podded.

He woke up in his [clone](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o) a short time later with no major negative effects, and quickly signed a new clone contract with Vivant Clone Repositories for an up-to-date clone.
