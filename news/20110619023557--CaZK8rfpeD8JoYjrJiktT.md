Group Stages for the Ninth Alliance Tournament are complete and the first rounds of the Finals are set for tomorrow.  
  
No flagships were fielded today, but several large ISK offers to throw matches kept things interesting.  
  
With some group leaders already in such dominant positions, several matches had no effect on position in the finals. This also applied to lower ranking participants who saw no need to put in much effort as they were already out of the finals based on points; the last match of the day included a conga line of two teams who were already effectively out of the tournament.  
  
Brackets for the Finals are set up and the action will resume tomorrow. Clicking on our "Rankings" tab will take you to the brackets where you can easily find who your favorite team will be fighting tomorrow.   
  
Match reports and statistics are available on the Interstellar Correspondents' website.
