# Ouria
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/ouria

Admiral Ouria was a [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) Admiral who had gone
rogue after giving away a high-technology item to a non-Jove, thus
violating the non-interference law imposed by the [Jovian Directorate](LnfvFctQjjYSZkNtlIWH1) upon all its subjects.
Ouria's defection was discovered when word spread of a secret meeting
taking place somewhere in the Stain region of space between a group of
Jove and an unknown party. During this meeting, an
[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) pilot who had been determined to investigate
the proceedings was shot down by Jove ships, sparking a diplomatic
incident between the two empires.
Following this, the Jove released the information that Admiral Ouria had
been stricken with the deadly psychological disorder known as the
[Jovian Disease](23mdEc1035XOWRcmorPJYf) and declared him an exile
from the Jove Empire, disavowing responsibility and denouncing his
actions. [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) went one step further, placing a
100 million ISK bounty on his head.

Reports continued to resurface sporadically from the Stain region, where
Ouria's renegade band was rumored to be scouting around for territories
to set up operations in. Their attempts were met with sustained
resistance from the corporations of the Stain Alliance and after one
particularly bloody and decisive battle, Ouria managed to escape into
hiding. A few days later, information came to light that Ouria had
developed ties with the infamous [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) rebel
faction Oracle and rumors circled that he was in talks with them about
an alliance. After managing to intercept communications between Ouria
and one of his brothers, CONCORD was able to issue a general warning for
the sectors of Stain space where the Admiral was believed to be located.
Following this narrowing of the field, a massive fleet of Stain Alliance
ships tracked down and engaged Ouria and his contingent of Oracle
soldiers, defeating the Jove and his Minmatar cohorts after a long and
bloody struggle.

Admiral Ouria and [Veniel](6F2KAgfLHr9Zx6twEbJXDa) were often seen together.
