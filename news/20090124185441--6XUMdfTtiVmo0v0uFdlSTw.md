Despite what many pod pilots felt was going to be an Ishtar vs. Ishtar tournament, the first 16 teams have fielded a wide variety of ships including marauders and frigates.

Several teams have already fielded specific-class ships in their fleets. Most notable were Against ALL Authorities' team of nine Fleet Issue Stabbers and a single Claymore, and Cult of War's team of eight Caracal Navy Issues and a pair of Lachesis cruisers.

Electronic warfare was used extensively as well, as demonstrated by the use of tracking disruptors and a large swarm of electronic warfare drones deployed by Dead Terrorists on their win against Alternative Reality.

Coverage will continue throughout the event and full match reports can be found on [GalNet](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=981389 "Galnet").
