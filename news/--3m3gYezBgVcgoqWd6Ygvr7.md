# Nanite-Infused Makeup
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/nanite-infused-makeup

**Nanite-infused makeup** can be applied to human faces. The nanites are
able to alter the color of the makeup in very specific ways, forming
rapidly changing shapes and patterns. The nanites are so precise they
can be used to play out cartoons on a person's cheeks.

[Cherall](1rzSTLqlstsXunsk1zG2mB) uses them on his holo show.
