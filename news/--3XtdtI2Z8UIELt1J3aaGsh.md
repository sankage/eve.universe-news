# 25ers
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/25ers

The **25ers** were a group of biologists and sociologists, and when the
need for a standardized time throughout [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) was identified, they claimed that
the only measurement worth considering in a space-faring age was that of
the human body. The internal body clock of humans is close to 25 hours,
and thus they wanted to base the new clock on that measurement.

Origins
-------

The 25ers was a small [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) grass-root
organization led by an energetic young man by the name of [Cerb-Rausolle](1iYIFXHlY8qwdC94a87Dg8),
although he preferred the pseudonym
the Astrologer. Through the efforts of the Astrologer the 25ers gained
great public support, spurred on by the surprisingly big network put
into place by the Astrologer. They lost the campaign to have the 25 hour
clock introduced at the Yoiul Conference to the
[Traditionalists](3GyBRROy5SG2FfJS1SdTEC).

Post-Yoiul Activities
---------------------

After the Yoiul Conference, Cerb Rausolle decided to use his group's
influence for other causes. At that time space ship owners were required
to pay huge amounts of money each year for their ship license. This was
something that all the empires enforced as it provided a good deal of
income for them, along with ensuring that only the cream of society
could afford to be in space business. Of course, this also hampered
space trade and made it difficult for the average Joe to get into the
business.

The Astrologer and his organization (still called the 25ers) started
lobbying for a change in the legislation. Since
[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) was responsible for issuing ship licenses
and collecting the license fees, it became the target of the
demonstrations organized by the 25ers.

At first CONCORD ignored the protests, but as they became more serious
it began taking notice. As it had been recently formed, CONCORD was
concerned about the image it was projecting to the public and a
committee was formed to handle the matter. As is often the case, things
dragged on for months. All the while the Astrologer was planning more
and more outrageous acts of protest, even going so far as to organize
general strikes on some planets.

The icing on the cake came during the first New Year celebration,
celebrating YC 1, at the headquarters of CONCORD. The Astrologer then
managed to infiltrate the station's defense perimeter with a lone,
unmanned cargo ship filled with explosives, which he then promptly
detonated outside the station in plain view of many of New Eden's most
prominent people. The Astrologer was careful not to blow the ship up so
close as to injure any of the guests, but his message was heard loud and
clear. Two months later new CONCORD legislation abolishing the license
fees was passed by all the member states.

Later Years
-----------

The Astrologer, now a fugitive after his stunt, quickly became a living
legend. The 25ers organization was dismantled and the Astrologer lost
his status as the champion of the people. But his name is not forgotten,
nor that of the 25ers, and every now and then a new group is formed
somewhere in the world of New Eden, proclaiming itself as the successor
of the old 25ers, dreaming of reliving the times when the little men
defeated the big guns.
