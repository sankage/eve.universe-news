Aset - The Republic Fleet has signaled that is has taken operational control over rescue operations at the asteroid mine in Aset today and it's first act was to enact a full blackout of communications leaving the site.

The Fleet already had a strong presence at the site, providing security and specialist teams to assist in the rescue.  The Tribal Liberation Force, the Republics capsuleer militia, had also been requested to provide additional system security during rescue operations.

The last communication from the site was a report filed by Khalial Vik, stating that his team thought they had found the source of the equipment disruption and that it seemed to be emanating from the asteroid core itself.   Attempts were underway to see if they could nullify the effects and determine their cause.

The Fleet has yet to give an explanation for this move.
