Sarum Prime - The Imperial Navy has unexpectedly withdrawn all of its warships from the colossal fleet battle over the skies of Mekhios. In what was largely being described as a "brutal stalemate" between the two armadas, the fighting came to an abrupt halt as Imperial Navy warships disengaged en-masse and warped away from the Elder Fleet, which made no attempt to pursue the fleeing defenders. Military analysts can provide no explanation for the sudden departure, and are speculating that Grand Admiral Sundara has opted to abandon Domain and regroup in the Kor-Azor Region. 

Fierce surface battles continue to rage across Mekhios as streams of Elder dropships ferry troops and armor to the surface.
