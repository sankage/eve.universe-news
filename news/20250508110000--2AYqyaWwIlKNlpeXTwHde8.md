### Faction Delegates Convene

A think tank held as part of a “Drifter Summit” in Jita 4-4 has endorsed a controversial future direction put forward by EDENCOM delegates. Organized by the Sisters of EVE and facilitated by the Arataka Research Consortium, the summit was held inside Jita 4-4 on YC127-05-01.

Delegates from all five Drifter wormhole-occupying factions met to discuss issues pertaining to the ongoing war with the Drifters. Aiming to garner wider support from those assembled in the hopes of influencing future policies, Capsuleer representatives from the Amarr Empire, Caldari State, EDENCOM, Minmatar Republic, and Triglavian Collective gathered. The Triglavians themselves could not be invited to attend due to the ongoing conflict in Pochven, and instead, a group of Kybernauts joined on their behalf.

Three topics were opened up to discussion: research sharing, the Drifter hyperspace network, and the continued military response to the Drifters.  All those present agreed that a policy of aggressive experimentation programs is the best approach to the hyperspace network, and that military resources should be dedicated to the continued assault on remaining Drifter forces.

Controversy broke out over the first topic of how to manage the sharing of research gathered from the Drifter wormhole systems. The Amarr, Caldari, and Triglavians agreed that a joint research program between those that had claimed a wormhole would be the best path forwards. Minmatar and EDENCOM representatives instead suggested that more open policies that were inclusive of outsider factions would be the best route forwards.

The gallery members agreed to support both Minmatar and EDENCOM, ultimately choosing EDENCOM to lead the proposal. EDENCOM's victory was by a narrow margin after a preferential voting runoff.

Provost Marshall was approached to comment on the result and described it as “an interesting discussion.” “EDENCOM is and always has been focused on the defense of our cluster,” she stated. “The knowledge we gain from investigations into the Sentinel MZ will be used to that end. How best we achieve that, and who should participate in that endeavor, is something we will be considering with great care.”

While positions taken by representatives were advisory in nature and not binding for faction leadership, they have garnered wider criticism from many politically-minded capsuleers. Rumors of the summit sparked strong responses from capsuleers concerned that their own factions would be swayed by the arguments of the EDENCOM and Minmatar loyalists. Additional unverified rumors are circulating of possible attempts to block these groups' progress inside Barbican and Sentinel, allowing them to fall to the Drifters rather than risking Drifter technology being made available outside the five occupying factions. When asked what she thought of these rumors, Provost responded, “Anyone who would disrupt our attempts to further their own agenda is not doing harm to EDENCOM, they are putting at risk the fate of the whole cluster. We must crush the enemy on every front or else their tyrannical vision of our annihilation will forever remain a threat. The petty pleas of nationalists and the threats of Triglavian sympathizers only serve to play into the hands of the Drifters.”

The true impact of the adopted proposal on New Eden will only become clear with time.
