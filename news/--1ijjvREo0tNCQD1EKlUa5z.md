Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/jacus-roden

Jacus Roden served two terms as the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E) from YC112 until YC122. Formerly known as an eccentric billionaire arms dealer, he is a slight man, about five foot seven, appearing to be around sixty years old with a slow deliberate manner and a perfectly hairless head. He has a metallic jaw, a streak of iron that runs from the side of his neck to the bottom of his chin. He brought the entire Gallente military-industrial complex together against [Executive Order 81042](1Pnj7uoKMDBOd9MsOea3P2). The fallout from the order led to the resignation of [Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) and Roden's election.
