# Transparent Nanoalloy

**Transparent nanoalloy** is the most commonly used material in the
construction of windows for ships, stations, and other space-based
facilities.

Historical Background
---------------------

Nanoalloys, an alloy consisting of dispersed nanoparticles of two or
more metals, have been around for a long time. The earliest experiments
with these types of materials were a key technology required for space
exploration, however, at only a few hundred years old, transparent
nanoalloy is a relatively new advancement in the field. Serving the same
function glass does on habitable planets, its ability to allow only
light photons to pass through it, while blocking all other forms of
electro-magnetic photons, make it ideally suited for this purpose in
no-atmosphere environments.

Previous transparent materials required so much shielding and hardening
that the transparency was impaired. As a result, station and ship
designers made minimal use of viewing structures of any kind. The
invention of transparent nanoalloy caused a revolution in both station
and ship construction as designers increasingly incorporated windows,
portals, and transparent structures, in some cases capping entire
facilities with massive domes made of the material.
