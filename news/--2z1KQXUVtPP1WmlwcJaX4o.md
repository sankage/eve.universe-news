# EVE Gate
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/eve-gate

The **EVE Gate** is a giant jump gate located in the New Eden system.
The letters "EVE" are prominently written over the top of the gate,
although their meaning is unknown.

Although located three light-years from New Eden's star, the gate can be
seen as a bright 'blob' in the sky. At this distance, it would take
several years of high-speed travel to reach. The
[Sisters of EVE](77ihwsVRHRojCaPC5XZn2g), and possibly others, conduct research
on the gate despite the enormous amount of radiation it emits.

It is a common belief that, several millennia ago,
[humanity's ancestors](1XoG8Nce8LC8gU3N24nkA1) traveled through this gate and its
then-stable wormhole to populate the [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) cluster.
When the wormhole later
collapsed, the colonies were severed from the worlds which sustained
them, bringing a dark age upon the inhabitable worlds. Millions perished
on other colonies in the ensuing chaos.

It is rumored that the wrecks of many ships destroyed during the gate's
final days still float in the void around the EVE Gate. The lack of
wreckage detected by scanners has not culled the speculation; some say
that the ancient vessels have been cloaked by the
[Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) to prevent advanced technology from falling into
the wrong hands.

The EVE Gate is part of the religious beliefs of the Sisters of EVE.
They believe it to be a gift from God and that it is His will that they
study it thoroughly and unlock its secrets. According to the Sisters,
God lives on the other side of the gate.
