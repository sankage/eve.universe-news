A series of explosions has forced station owners to shut down the docking facilities at the Ameinaka IX - Moon 21 - Six Kin Development Warehouse station. It's generally believed that the damage was caused by a meteor and repairs are underway. Pilots are asked not to attempt docking there until further notice, as the docking facilites are now running on emergency power and can not support sensors or communication systems.
