**Tadama** is the ex-wife of [Cherall](1rzSTLqlstsXunsk1zG2mB). She was
contacted by [the Bleeding Hearts of Matar](6dnrAA9AjQYVqCIiXoHfr) after they kidnapped her
daughter, [Prandi](38jVUkfdQ8xoIw5akylH0R). They told her to inform Cherall,
which she did.

After Cherall contacted them and learns they wanted him to cancel his
show and renounce his faith on air, Tadama urged him to do so. When
Cherall told her that his partner of thirty years,
[Samne](1f0aCFFod3nVVVcvDYL7cQ), had been kidnapped and murdered by the same
group, she realized that Cherall did not plan on acquiescing to their
demands. Despite being warned about going to the police, she vowed to do
so.
