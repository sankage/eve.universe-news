# Unique interstellar sites
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/unique-interstellar-sites

Some **locations** in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) cannot
be tied to planets, moons, suns or even stations or other particular
celestial objects, but are nonetheless so renowned through the cluster
that they deserve their own entries. Other locations relate to specific
locations, usually planetside, but have become so famous that their
reputations have extended to celestial heights.

Notable interstellar locations
------------------------------

-   The [Golgothan Fields](42oxJZbTitYjBLLLOEEqh5) are a site of

### Others

There is also a number of locations whose exact nature, location or name
is as yet unknown:

-   Sites (wreckage guarded by pirates) where [Nale's](6UCrnplXyEjy3djnjEKnUq)
    search team found pieces, both real and fake, related to a
    mind-control machine codenamed the Book of Emptiness.
-   Site where drone research was being undertaken, right up until the
    point where at least [one drone](unnamed-rogue-drone-lore) went rogue and
    slaughtered everyone.
-   Wherever the [Mind Clash](22qTwYMQWYFPScEBt16DVA) World Championship
    are held.
-   There is an asteroid mining colony in the depths of lowsec space
    where the Empires vie for control. With the coming of the
    [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) combatants, the majority of the
    crew have abandoned, leaving behind only a skeleton crew. Just as
    the skeleton crew is growing capable of running the colony, a group
    of pirates attack. They detonate surface explosives to collapse
    several sections, then board the colony and begin a rampage. They
    manage to kill most of the inhabitants with their laser guns. Only
    [Adek](4PQKp7FBmnvpxkpuHGB36v) manages to escape. He reaches the Pit, the
    section of the asteroid that has been mined out extensively and has
    several tunnels that lead right next to the vacuum of space. Adek
    initially plans to give up, but has a sudden burst of inspiration.
    He goes to the Pit's control station and sets off an alarm, drawing
    the entire pirate party to the Pit. He then remotely activates an
    [MTAC](6tgB9Z8SmRZ7VUX3qScODq) to punch a hole into the vacuum, blowing
    several pirates into space and causing the rest to lose their
    weapons and become helpless. Adek boards an MTAC and finishes off
    the rest. As he waits, he discovers one pirate had stayed behind.
    Adek discovers that a capsuleer has arrived outside the colony. He
    sends out a distress call, telling the capsuleer what has happened
    and saying the colony should be destroyed and the cargo retrieved.
    Adek then runs to a cargo container, seals himself inside, and waits
    as the capsuleer destroys the colony.
-   There is a [CreoDron](3lCriaLYr0Nrmj9pkru5Z3) boardroom that shows a
    view of the pale blue Carirgnottin I in front of a glowing crimson
    nebula through one of the clear walls. Dim starlight also shines
    through onto a large table that has a speaker set into the middle
    of it. It is in this boardroom the existence of a civilization in
    wormhole space was first brought to light, as well as where the
    decision was made to send a person through a wormhole.
-   An unnamed colony, located somewhere within Gallente space, but
    occupied by the Caldari State during [YC111](1nWwkV0QgotpxAOb5HQ6CA).
    Resources on this colony are scarce.
-   An unnamed asteroid colony in the middle of nowhere. Visitors are
    given coordinates and then their ship is disabled before they are
    brought inside. A city of stone is encased inside the asteroid and
    the colonists live off of it. Stalactites like cathedrals hang from
    above while stalagmites are hollowed out and used as buildings.

Notable planetary locations
---------------------------

There is a number of locations extant on planetary surfaces:

-   [Amarr Island](4wZzhhUMIfR4ziHGaMOiLJ) on [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4). It is small enough that a solar

    -   The [Crystal Boulevard](45ZcfxzqF7v2mqmLksGxYU) is one of
        those wonders.
    -   The [Glittering Dream](WPpsbdA18JYzPyQlCNQh3) nightclub is
        one, too.
-   The [Court Chamberlain's antechamber](3W4krTLGOQqhYqlc2qAG1N) was a

-   The [Kaalakiota Peaks](tSXx52ZNNlyu2MYXtOiMT) are very
    important set of mountains on Caldari Prime.
-   [Nouvelle Rouvenor](7aF13uW1tkTLI8stM52xK), a once-notorious
    underwater Caldari city.
-   [Outpost 4972](7lJLYLN8srQsuRHZJsCfVR) was the site of a theft and
    a brutal interrogation.

    on Amarr Prime.
-   [Torsad-Laur](2w4NAgugzCIUNDLfeIk0C8) is a cultural mixing pot.

### Others

As with interstellar locations, though, there is also a number of
planetside places whose exact nature, location, name or planetary origin
is as yet unknown:

-   The Amarr Royal Court, where, among other things, Mind Clash is
    played.
-   There are various Caldari gambling halls, where, among other games,
    it is possible to see games of Mind Clash.
-   Several Society of Conscious Thought [Kitzes](4Sgvr2KzwFRAX0nwKpGNSW)
    exist.
-   [King Khanid's](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf) stolen
    [Titan](XH5ZPvSBGGIStAEWqWHOl), of whatever antique design it may be, is
    presumably floating around somewhere still, as Titans cannot be
    docked.
-   There is an unknown prisoner planet in the Minmatar Republic.
    Somewhere on the planet, in the middle of a desert surrounded by a
    swampy jungle, is a prison complex housing Amarr prisoners that have
    been secretly tried by Minmatar military courts and deemed a threat
    to freedom. Wild slaver hounds live in the jungle. Supplies are
    hot-dropped into the desert, where they are retrieved by specially
    selected prisoners. The guards at the camp cruelly force the
    prisoners to play "games" or risk severe punishment. Physical and
    sexual abuse of the prisoners is common, and prisoners are
    overworked in order to break their spirits. A man known as the King
    has escaped the prison camp and lives in a shack in the jungle. The
    guards and the King have some sort of agreement, as those who have
    found the King are spared participation in the guards' games.
-   In Gallente space, there is a somewhat rustic city with stone
    buildings and streets, wooden fences, narrow alleyways
    and cul-de-sacs. It is located in the hemisphere known for rough
    weather on the planet.
