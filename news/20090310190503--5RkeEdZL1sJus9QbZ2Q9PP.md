Major corporations across New Eden are frantically allocating resources in order to repeat CreoDron's amazing discovery. 

According to an anonymous source inside Chemal Tech, "The R&D department in our firm had just received a lump sum of several billion ISK, taken from another project, in order to launch an expedition similar to CreoDron's as soon as possible."

Another source states a similar situation at Roden Shipyards. "The executives axed several R&D programs, freeing some cash for the new expedition. The new wormholes are on everyone's lips in the boardroom."

As of now, no corporations except CreoDron have reported any positive wormhole discoveries.
