SYSTEM SL-YBS 0952 - SCOPE News has learned that a Thukker caravan has been reported missing in the Great Wildlands region. The elusive tribe consulted with the Republic's Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor a short time ago, stating in confidence that the caravan's last checkpoint was a transit waypoint through the SL-YBS system.

Known for their nomadic culture, Thukker caravans typically consist of hundreds of vessels. Though home to large numbers of civilian tribesmen, they are generally well-armed and entirely self-sufficient, rarely if ever seeking port in stations.
