Villore VII – Moon 6 - Senate Bureau<br>
Vieres Constellation, Gallente Federation</p>

A tangle of voices echoed around the cavernous interior of the Senate chamber as the last group filed out through the main entrance, an uncountable number of dialects and accents slowly replaced with a stony silence.

His eyes remained downcast, his field of view filled with holofeeds from every corner of the besieged planet. To his right, closed circuit footage showed the glossy black surface of the Shintoko Tower, one of Arcurio’s most well-known landmarks, folding like a house of cards. Its lights flickered out like a thousand candles caught in the breeze as it toppled into two neighboring structures.

Directly in front of him, a burning armored personnel carrier emblazoned with the markings of the Caldari Providence Directorate crashed to a halt, slamming into parked vehicles in a crowded street littered with smoldering debris. A figure emerged as the hatch was thrown open, more of a shadow behind the glow of immolation than anything identifiably human. It battled against the heat, frantically attempting to flee the superheated wreckage. Upon doing so it was kicked and beaten into a lifeless burning heap by a bloodthirsty crowd.

His eyes moved on, head still downcast. An ocean of protestors with all manner of homemade weapons filled a broad, tree lined avenue in downtown Pakuri. A young woman no more than 20 years of age, holding the fluttering flag of the Gallente Federation, crumpled to the asphalt as a canister of riot control gas struck her sternum. She remained inanimate as the crowd surged over her toward the Provist blockade.

The sound of a quiet, smooth voice dragged his eyes from the carnage. “Mister President. I need a decision as soon as you’re ready. Our forces are on standby.”

He nodded his hairless head, his eyes returning to the mess of holographic images projected beneath the immaculate glass surface of the desk. He picked out the face of a handsome young Gallente man, sullied features locked in a scowl, lips moving in silent protest. Without looking up, he replied:

“And then what? If I give the green light, what happens next? This operation is a massive risk. If it fails, you know what Heth will do. It would be the biggest mistake of my life to think he wouldn't burn every shred of Gallente existence from Caldari Prime.”

Blaque approached him slowly as his words echoed around the empty chamber and his hand gestured to the carnage laid out on the surface of the desk. “Our people are dying on the ground. We can’t wait any longer. Whether he orders the Shiigeru to strike an hour or a year from now, so long as it stays in orbit and our citizens down there persist in causing unrest, it will remain a clear threat to the security of Luminaire. Heth’s reaction is something we can never fully prepare for.”

“Don’t lecture me, Mentas. I’m well aware of the situation. If the administration at the time hadn't been so damned spineless, we wouldn’t be in this position now” was the calm, quiet reply.

Blaque couldn’t help but allow himself a small smile as he watched Jacus Roden, President of the Gallente Federation, drum the fingertips of his right hand against the laminated surface of the desk. The older man let his eyes settle once more on the collage of destruction projected beneath his hand.

A low-slung, sleek white vehicle stood waiting at the black and yellow striped barrier of a Provist checkpoint. Roden ran the tips of his fingers over the grainy image of a Caldari Providence Directorate soldier, his rifle stood at his side as he stooped over to speak through the open window of the vehicle. A second later his neck snapped back, his head erupting in a crimson haze.

The rear wheels of the vehicle bounced over the tangled body, its nose pushing through the barrier and its bodywork riddled by small arms fire. Roden watched as a perfectly straight contrail of smoke extended from the guardhouse of the checkpoint like a bold line drawn across a sheet of paper. The detonation of the ‘Foxfire’ anti-personnel rocket tossed the vehicle through a tail over nose flip into a roadside drainage ditch, leaving a trail of fire and billowing black smoke in its wake.

“The situation is spiraling out of control down there. The Provists are losing grip and each hour we delay, we lose more lives to their heavy-handed action.” Blaque’s words were carefully delivered as he fixed his gaze on the top of Roden’s smooth-skinned head. “We need to make sure that the option to call in an orbital strike at the hands of Admiral Yanala is taken out of the equation.”

Roden pulled his attention from the charred remains of the vehicle as the Provists began to flank it in well-trained cover formation. He met the sharp amber gaze of Blaque. “I've seen enough. How long would we have to wait for a full deployment?”

“The Navy can move as soon as they have approval, but the FEDCAFT story we pushed to the media will only hold for so long. Sooner or later they’ll expect our forces to return to headquarters.” As Blaque finished the sentence, his eyes washed over the mess of video feeds in front of the President.

“Ranchel is confident that our forces can pull this off?” Roden’s tone was inquisitive, with a measure of wariness, his attention turning to Blaque across the desk. Blaque nodded in response.

“He has Admiral Bauvon in command of the strike force, over a thousand vessels at his disposal if needed. It will be a surprise offensive. We’ve been monitoring Caldari Navy communications in Black Rise. At present they believe that if we’re going to attack, we'll do so with a full-scale offensive against the State, rather than just Caldari Prime. The FIO has solid intelligence on this, and the diversion has worked. Phase one is complete, phase two needs nothing but your authorization.”

Roden rested his elbows on the surface of the desk, balling one hand into a fist, the second clasped around it as a rest for his chin. “And how do they predict that this will play out?”

“The Caldari Navy already has forces primed to jump to Luminaire should our cynosural inhibitor network be compromised. They’re always on standby. When we bring the net down, they’re liable to jump through at least a token reactionary force, but nothing we won’t be able to clean up given time and commitment. The main unknown factor is always going to be the behavior of capsuleers. If they realize what’s happening, they may see this as an offensive to take back Caldari Prime.”

Roden let out a slow sigh, his fingers gently rubbing over his clean-shaven chin. “They will soon realize that this is not the objective of the operation. Until then, our forces will have to deal with them as appropriate.”

“Frankly, for all I care, the State can keep that godforsaken icy rock. As for the Shiigeru, we can no longer tolerate its presence.” Blaque’s reply was without hesitation, a pause only for breath interrupting him. “It now presents an undeniable threat to the security of the Federation, and should never have been agreed upon after the invasion.”

President Roden gave a gentle nod of agreement. The words of his next sentence were delivered as if part of a speech, each one selected, analyzed thoroughly and approved before being spoken. “This operation will cost lives on both sides. The only saving grace is that the number of Federal casualties will be far lower if we act now instead of allowing Provist forces to unleash the full force of the Shiigeru on our people. You have my authorization for phase two.”

The response from Blaque was immediate, a hand thrust between the buttons of his crisp olive-colored jacket. He withdrew a sleek black datapad from his breast pocket and slid it across the desk to the President, who offered his thumb to a glowing green square on its holographic display. His words were slow and measured. “See to it that it’s done, and keep me updated every ten minutes until the operation is completed, regardless of the outcome.”

Blaque nodded in response, catching the device as it was slid back to him. “You have my word that the pilots selected for this operation are the finest the Federation Navy has to offer.” The younger man slid the small datapad back into his jacket before turning on his heel and making for the door. He lifted his fingers to his earpiece as he walked.

Roden’s eyes were drawn back to the surface of the desk long enough to watch the aftermath at the security checkpoint. Three Provist soldiers carefully wrapped their fallen squad member in a large black sheet before carrying him off toward the guardhouse. The old man lifted his attention from the collage of holographics in time to see the head and shoulders of 

Mentas Blaque vanish through the side exit of the Senate chamber, his last audible words echoing around the large open space.

“Ranchel? Blaque. Phase two of Operation Highlander is go. Deploy at your discretion.”

Caldari Prime – Outskirts of Arcurio – Altitude 1338 meters</p>

“Prepare for insertion! Six Minutes!”

Major Kuos Askulen sealed the hatch to the cockpit of the Sparrow-class dropship, before making a ‘v’ with his armored fingers as he walked the length of the troop compartment’s port side aisle. He double-tapped his cheeks in a gesture to his eyes, then pointed to the red light beside the dropship’s rear loading ramp, its domed lens illuminating as if on cue. His voice was raised over the deafening drone of the craft’s thrusters.

“Equipment check, be prepped to give these bastards hell!”

The dropship bucked violently in a hail of anti-aircraft fire, Askulen’s feet momentarily leaving the steel deck plating. The nausea of temporary weightlessness churned his stomach before his feet made contact again, and when they did, he staggered and bounced sideways, his armored form pressing into the lap of one of the seated men from his platoon. A muffled voice sounded out from beneath him.

“Damn, Sir, you gotta learn to control yourself until we’re off duty.”

Askulen righted himself, pressing a large hand down on the soldier’s helmet, deliberately skewing it to one side as he stood. He smirked from beneath his ‘Nightstalker’ tactical goggles as his retort came amidst a chorus of whistles and shouting.

“Only your sister gets that pleasure, and definitely only when I’m off duty. Get your shit in line and prepare to deploy.”

He continued walking, his head craning around to watch the platoon of sixty men prepare their equipment. The rattle and metallic snap of magazines being inserted into standard-issue Kaalakiota R-66A Assault Rifles was a familiar noise that always curled his lips into a smile. He reached the rear of the dropship and turned to face those under his command, gripping the well-worn framework above his head for support.

“Our objective is to re-secure the surface-to-orbit defense batteries at the southeast corner of District Nine. Our LZ is hot with Federal Defense Union activity, but secure for now. We're gonna set up a defensive perimeter, then move northwest to secure and man the batteries.

“Do not underestimate our hostiles. Reports indicate we’re up against a sizable force of these prototype soldiers that have been in the news. You’ve all had the briefing; you know what they’re capable of.”

The professionalism of his unit had always given him a supreme confidence in their ability to perform under fire. They were a credit to the Caldari Navy. He gave a nod, watching the well-trained squad run through their various pre-deployment checks.

Half way down the portside aisle, Second Lieutenant Oroki Matavo straightened out his ballistic helmet, glancing over to the soldier strapped into the seat opposite him. He kicked out at the other man’s armored boot to rouse his attention, shouting over the drone of the Sparrow’s thrusters.

“Hey Tsu, you hear that? We’re up against those cloned freaks. We gotta keep the squad close-cut, good spacing, hit 'em hard and fast and be prepped to knock out their CRU if they keep coming.”

Corporal Yon Tsuata nodded back across the aisle in agreement. “We got a good crew, solid command; we’ll be in good shape once we hit the ground. We knock out their infrastructure and they’re on the same playing field as we are.”

Matavo shook his head, giving a nervous laugh. “I wish I shared your optimism. The stories I’ve heard, these things can take a full mag from a 66A and just keep coming. We’re probably gonna run short on ammo before we kill enough of them.”

Tsuata opened his mouth to respond but before he could speak, the wind was knocked out of him with a hard metallic thump. He looked across the aisle to see a series of fist-sized holes open up along the Sparrow’s fuselage above Matavo's head, long shafts of light penetrating the armored hull as sparks bounced around the dropships interior.

His eyes were drawn downward with the realization that the warmth in his lap was coming from a hole in his thigh. There was no pain as his eyes followed the path of the armor piercing round. It led from a hole in the floor beneath the half of his foot and boot that remained, through his seat, then made entry through the back of his thigh and exit through its top. He barely had time to register the second entry wound below his left pectoral muscle before he lost consciousness.

Matavo’s mouth dropped open slightly as the young officer’s lifeless head lolled forward, a crimson trail leaking from his lips. Within seconds there was chaos as the troop compartment began to fill with thick black smoke. He reached forward, his restraints automatically loosening for an emergency drop as a second hail of fire from below riddled the side of the dropship, showering sparks and crimson across the floor. Matavo let out a shout, grabbing at the edge of what remained of his seat as he was pelted with a hail of soldiers and loose equipment.

The Sparrow banked hard to avoid another lethal burst of fire, failing to outmaneuver the lead that its aggressor had predicted. Its armored side was shredded in a third hail of depleted uranium, a dozen or so men thrown out through a gaping slash in the side of the craft. Matavo tightened his grip as the dropship spiraled wildly, flames from the port side thruster assembly licking in through the damaged hull.

He looked up as the sound of the co-pilot’s voice thundered through the troop compartment’s PA system. The stench of seared flesh almost overwhelmed his senses.

“Mayday, Mayday, this is Protectorate wing ‘Dragon’ two five seven. Port side thrusters knocked out, pilot KIA, zero control, we are going down. Repeat, we are going down. All personnel brace for crash landing.”

Matavo was thrown across the aisle toward the center of the craft as it banked hard again, before falling into a steep dive. He wrapped his arms around one of the structural supports, narrowly avoiding a surge of bodies that tumbled toward the front of the craft. Those of his unit who were still alive scrambled to brace themselves for a hard landing.

He looked up toward the rear of the dropship as the body of Major Askulen rolled past him, and couldn’t help smiling at the irony of the red light that suddenly turned green, as if oblivious to the chaos. The loading ramp yawned open and spilled personnel and equipment into the trail of thick black smoke that followed the craft and through the tangle of debris his eyes caught sight of something beautiful in the amber evening sky.

Some 340 kilometers above, the setting sun refracted off the hull of the Shiigeru. The vessel the Sparrow-class had been dispatched from, the bastion of armored Caldari steel that had served as his home for the last three years of his deployment.

He watched her sleek hull shimmer behind the heat haze trailing from the crippled dropship. Loose crates of equipment and dead members of his platoon tumbled past him, thrust out through the rear of the craft by a funnel of air forced in through its damaged side.

Several more sleek grey hulls streaked into the sky above. They were distant, but easily recognizable as the silhouettes of four Wyvern-class supercarriers that had joined the Shiigeru. He remained transfixed, and for a split second he smiled again, before a blinding white flash removed him from existence.

Caldari Prime – 227km south east of Arcurio – District 9</p>

The well-worn bronze frame of the Boundless Creation MH-82 Heavy Machine Gun rubbed against her armored thigh, her boots kicking up a trail of dust as she ascended the steep side of the hill. The matte black hulls of three Sparrow-class dropships thundered across the evening sky above her head. The tactical heads-up display within her dropsuit’s helmet marked them with red brackets and provided velocity and altitude readouts as she glanced skyward.

On reaching the summit she drew in a long breath, the coarse rasp of the respirator filling her ears. The dropships banked hard toward southern Arcurio and passed through a column of thick white smoke, twisting it into a coil in their wake. Movement in her peripheral vision drew her attention away from the flying machines.

A Saga model light attack vehicle bounced across open ground, its unarmored driver and passenger’s heads swaying with the rough ride. Their gunner, dressed in the combat uniform of a Provist occupation force infantryman, was almost thrown from the vehicle as he attempted to keep a barrage of antimatter fire on a pursuing vehicle that was obscured by dust.

She crouched on the crest of the hill, easily supporting the sixty-kilo bulk of the MH-82 in her augmented arms. Her heads-up display instantly recognized the target, providing its velocity, heading and an estimation of its condition and combat readiness. When she pulled the trigger, the weapon roared into life.

Quad rotary barrels belched flames three times the length of the weapon, the cloned brain of its operator predicting a perfect lead. A maelstrom of dust and dry soil was thrown up around the vehicle as it rolled over like a discarded toy, riddled by a hail of depleted uranium rounds. 

She pulsed the trigger in two-second bursts to prevent the weapon from overheating, stopping only to allow the pursuing friendly vehicle to cross her line of fire and vanish over the opposite hill. After another three bursts, the rotating barrel gave off a soft whine, spooling down as she spoke to the other members of her squad.

“This is Highlander Two Niner, Unit Six. Hostile scout patrol neutralized. Awaiting further orders.”

“Acknowledged, Unit Six, resume anti-air support,” was the immediate reply, distorted by gunfire.

She remained crouched, one knee in the dirt as a wing of three more Sparrow-class dropships tore across the sky above her head.

Flames jetted from the weapon, its aim lifted as a hail of countermeasure flares poured from the rear of the dropships. She smirked behind her visor, her heads-up temporarily blinded but her brain operating on instinct no mortal soldier could match. A simple neural command from her occipital implant magnified her vision instantly, drawing the silhouette of her target fifty times closer.

A hail of rounds struck their mark, two bursts of fire shredding the snarling painted nose of the lead dropship and punching holes in the numbers ‘257’ along its side. It belched a contrail of black smoke and shimmering debris, rolling over and spiraling into a steep dive.

She let loose a third barrage of fire and watched as a trail of equipment and infantry poured from the craft, its burning fuselage vanishing behind a distant hilltop. Her visor returned to the correct visual plane in time for her to witness an angry orange mushroom cloud rise into the air, followed by the distant rumble of the dropship’s impact.

Caldari Prime – 171km south east of Arcurio – District 2</p>

“Move! Move! Move! Forward!”

Six sets of heavily armored boots pounded the rough ground as the squad advanced. Two of the men broke off to the left, rounding the battered side of a reinforced concrete silo as First Lieutenant Odaki Tunen’s voice burst into their ears.

“Dragon 257 didn’t make it. We push forward. We can do this.”

Another pair of the State Protectorate soldiers split off from the group, flanking right and using two large logistics transports as cover. The young Lieutenant rested his armored back against the side of the domed four-story silo, his respirator rasping harshly as a voice broke across comms into his helmet. As he listened, those on the right flank drew closer to the side of the target building behind the transports.

“This is Imaya. Shiwari and I are in place. Left flank is clear, keep them distracted.”

“Position acknowledged, move forward at your own discretion.”

Tunen remained crouched, peering around the side of the silo toward the building, its front riddled with impact marks from heavy caliber projectile fire. The devastated carcasses of two tangled Caldari LAVs littered the asphalt in front of the building. The other man in his pair, Corporal Tarawa Oiki, unslung a CBR7 Swarm Launcher from his shoulder, flicking the arming switch and bringing the stock up against his collarbone.

Lieutenant Tunen nodded, bracing the fold-out stock of his Ishukone Assault Submachine Gun against his shoulder, its barrel pointed around the wall at the front of the building. He let off a hail of rounds toward the front of the building, shredding the concrete around two of the closest windows. A split second later secure comms lit up, sending his voice flooding into the whole squad's ears.

“Covering fire! Move forward!”

He watched the muzzle flashes in his peripheral vision as the two squad members on the right flank opened up with a pair of S-1 Forge Guns. Massive chunks of concrete were hurled from the front of the single story building as the first round made impact, blasting a hole clean into the building. The second round passed through the opening, lighting up the windows from inside with a series of vibrant blue flashes.

Tunen smiled behind his visor, letting the empty magazine clatter to the ground from the grip of his SMG. With a hard metallic click, a replacement was slid into the slot in time to hose down the three shell-shocked Federal Marines that staggered from the gaping hole in the side of the building.

His head snapped to the left as a rumble from inside the silo caught his attention, the ammunition inside it starting to shift.

“They’re preparing to fire! Left flank, advance after swarm!”

Corporal Oiki flicked up the sight of the Swarm launcher, bracing his lower body to absorb the recoil and aiming the barrel of the weapon around the corner of the silo. With the depression of the trigger, a salvo of self-guiding missiles was released. They corkscrewed, following the contour of the ground before several of them took a route into the building via a shattered window, the rest using the massive hole in the wall. There was silence, and then a series of loud reports came from within the building and the rest of the windows blew out in a hail of glistening shrapnel.

Oiki nodded across the open ground to the two soldiers bearing the forge guns. Their spent weapons were dropped, replaced in their hands by Ishukone-designed submachine guns. They advanced on the building, their black-clad forms slinking between the wreckage that littered the front of the building like beads of oil through conduits. They were joined by the men from the left flank, vanishing into the smoke that poured from the hole in the wall.

A number of muzzle flashes from small arms lit up the windows as the men began to systematically clear the building. Screams in both Gallente and Caldari echoed out through the frame of the shattered building. Tunen nodded to Oiki, following him to the left while using the silos as cover on approach.

As the Lieutenant advanced, something caught his eye. He slowed to a walk, tilting his head as dust and sand blew over a matte black form slumped against the back of the silo. The gun reports became more distant to him as he reached behind his ear, clicking the release for his visor and blinking several times as the bright light hit his eyes. He inhaled the dusty air, the first time he’d ever done so on his people’s ancestral home world, and rested a titanium-kevlar-covered knee on the ground between a pair of lifeless legs.

His eyes inspected the armored form of the State Protectorate officer, his chest plate and helmet having taken a full frontal impact from a heavy caliber weapon. He was brought back to reality as the sound of the swarm launcher tore through his senses. Oiki’s voice filled his ears:

“Sir, we have to advance. Let’s move. Building is clear.”

The Lieutenant nodded, even though his Corporal was out of sight. He replied without hesitation.

“Squad, sound off.”

“Clear!” were the five responses in quick succession.

Tunen was mesmerized for a few seconds more as he looked into his own eyes. It was the first time he’d ever seen himself dead. His vacant, dust-covered features were visible through his shattered visor, identical but lifeless eyes staring back at him.

He rifled through his own corpse’s equipment, snatching up a belt of M1 Locus grenades and a Cerberus CRG-3 shotgun before standing. In a macabre gesture he winked, then smirked at himself, before making his way around the side of the silo to link up with his squad.
