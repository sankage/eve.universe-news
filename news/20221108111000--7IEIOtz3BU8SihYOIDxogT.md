## BREAKING - Massive Invasion of Intaki and Placid Systems by Federation Navy

Intaki, Placid Region â€“ The Gallente Federation Navy has launched a massive invasion of the Intaki system and a number of surrounding systems in Placid region, according to multiple reports incoming from local sources. Large Federation Navy capital fleets have been spotted in system amidst an unprecedented level of cynosural beacon activity.

Scattered reports from the Intaki system indicate that Caldari Navy forces are fighting a rearguard action against overwhelming Federation Navy forces. Some reports indicate the entire Viriette constellation has been invaded by Federation forces with some reports indicating an even wider assault across systems close to the borders with Verge Vendor.

Communications with civilian planetary and space installation authorities are heavily disrupted. The situation on Intaki Prime is unclear but the planet was under the control of the local Intaki Assembly and its planetary militia prior to these dramatic events.

There are reports from Luminaire that President Celes Aguard is preparing to address the Gallente Federation.

The Scope will continue monitoring this rapidly developing situation.
