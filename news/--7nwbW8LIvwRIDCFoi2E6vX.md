# Gallente franchise system
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/gallente-franchise-system

The **Gallente franchise system** is used by
[Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) member states to delegate out various
responsibilities to outside bodies regarding the economic activities of
their home system. It is considered the primary legal vehicle
for member states to engage in star system development by utilizing the
competitive free market system. The franchise system identifies the most
common concerns of a Federation star system, and provides a codified
method for member states to scope out independent franchisees from
across the union, stimulating public-private relations.

Because not all member states are interested in matters beyond their own
borders or the affairs of their solar system, there is no obligation to
utilize the franchise system. This is frequently true of star systems
composed of multiple member states (particularly when the states are in
opposition with one another), or member states that feel their
sovereignty may be infringed by delegating responsibilities to outside
interests. On the other hand, those member states who do utilize the
franchise system frequently find themselves far better off in terms of
hard development figures than those who do not.

Franchises
----------

The three largest franchises are Shipping & Security (S&S), Astromining,
and Communication. Because there are no restrictions behind a member
state's choice of a franchisee, entities from outside the Federation can
be found providing the above franchises. In the Intaki solar system, the
[Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) and [Mordu's Legion](5csCeDqUe1exvVyfPdL75Q) are the joint providers of the
Shipping & Security franchise. In the Algintal constellation,
[Wiyrkomi](66psXtrftjRzA7MyKHtb7K) control the Astromining
franchise. [Nugoeihuvi](4Ykng1Buej1uH3Sy5ln3jW) are one of
the more notable Communication franchisees of non-Federation origin,
particularly in Sinq Laison.

While there are various other franchises recognized by the system, they
are not considered to be widespread enough to warrant mention here.

### Shipping & Security (S&S)

S&S is widely considered the most important franchise due to
interstellar trade being core to the Federation's economy. S&S
franchisees are responsible for protecting and regulating the commercial
shipping lanes necessary for sustaining the weave of economic
interdependency (if any) between all planets and space habitats in a
star system. The franchisee may be responsible for the system's trade
lanes as a whole, providing vessels needed to ship goods between
settlements. It may also be in charge of customs, monitoring the star
system's imports and exports.

S&S is most commonly franchised out to the [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) and
[Federation Customs](2LZwH7MsRSRhlMHNegrgGx), though interstellar retail
and shipping corporations are other notable providers, including
[FedMart](2Aa82GwowUlH7gWR8uItZU), [Aliastra](3iX0hBIWuaj6e76ROt5YV6),
[Federal Freight](74IjjXuOHEtuSavj8rj095), [Inner Zone Shipping](6jvpK2n6YJcVRR77mgiwO2), [TransStellar Shipping](6H2gOgexrSym6Oy0bxTnf6), and [InterBus](5qPzJs2ctePXqXGbgXmAMr). Another prevalent approach is
franchising out independent starship captains or private military
companies for S&S.

### Astromining

The Astromining franchise concerns the mineral rights over the asteroid
belts in a star system. Ownership of asteroid belts can be a consistent
point of conflict between the members states of a system, necessitating
the need to delegate asteroid mining to third parties. The Astromining
franchisee is responsible for ensuring that all member states in a star
system receive a fair share of the minerals available. In return, the
franchisee is permitted to retain a cut of the minerals for selling
elsewhere.

[Astral Mining Inc.](3TG9nQMZP4ye5PwODt2DWt) is the largest single
provider of the Astromining franchise in the Federation, followed by
[Material Acquisition](uU1699OxOEmlDBcMm0qZA), though
thousands of smaller companies and individual entrepreneurs are
available otherwise.

### Communication

The Communication franchise's importance stems from the need of
utilizing [FTL technology](slULqrFiu06fLmeraX1QL) to proliferate
GalNet access as far and wide as possible across the expanse of the
Federation. This is both done for political and economic reasons, such
as facilitating e-democracy and connecting to the regional markets, but
it is also done in the name of pursuing a digitally integrated
interstellar society where all citizens have free access to limitless
information. Communication franchisees are responsible for constructing
and maintaining FTL relays and fluid routers across a star system,
ensuring that all settlements in space are connected to both GalNet and
planetary networks. The large expenses required for this means that only
New Eden's largest corporations are capable of fulfilling this
franchise. The Federation government often subsidizes this franchise.

Media corporations like [The Scope](jKoaYpOfHALTiwPIlGbE6) and
[Impetus](hph5RyllJ61G3aO6A0m4g), the larger academic institutes such as
the [University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM) and [Center for Advanced Studies](4meVrOQgzGASATNfmHbgOR), and
hi-tech megacorporations are amongst the largest Communication
franchisees in the Federation.
