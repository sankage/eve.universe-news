# Mordu's Legion Command
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/mordus-legion-command

The origin of Mordu's Legion lies in the Gallente-Caldari War when a group of Intaki military personnel sided with the Caldari. The Intakis were put into a separate unit with a Caldari officer named Mordu. After the war the Intakis settled in Caldari space, but unwillingly became entangled with Caldari locals in the Waschi Uprising. Mordu's Legion was formed at that time as a mercenary fighting force and after the uprising it continued its existence.

The Legion is loosely associated with the Caldari Navy, but is for the most part totally independent. Mordu's Legion is commonly hired by companies to protect valuable assets outside empire space, for instance Outer Ring Excavations pays them handsomely to patrol the Outer Ring region.
