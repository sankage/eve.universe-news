**Robert ('Bob')** is a station worker originally in charge of Tech I
blueprint improvement and approval for
a subsection of his corporation. He's a nervous type, overweight and
nearing retirement age, who puts great stock in having the work routines
of today resemble as much as possible those of yesterday. Modern
communications methods are anathema to him, and his
office usually has the door firmly
closed.

When Tech II blueprints for various ship
modules came out, Bob was working for [Duvolle Laboratories](1khBWLK52GfHvRQ1xUrOPb), though likely not for a
whole lot longer.
