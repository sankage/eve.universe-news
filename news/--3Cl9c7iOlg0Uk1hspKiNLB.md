October
=======

Minmatar and Ammatar
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The troubled political situation in the Minmatar Republic seemed without
a quick resolution as the [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) and
[Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2) tribes expressed concerns as whether
they would be able to secure equal representation within Minmatar
political structures. The Starkmanir in particular seemed to be finding
the transition from life as an entirely-enslaved tribe to free citizens
a difficult one. Certainly, with no chief appointed for either of the
two returned tribes, the much-anticipated Tribal Assembly seemed likely
to be further delayed.

In contrast, the fortunes of the Ammatar who had remained in the
[Ardishapur](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO)-controlled
[Mandate](4BV4ldw5RdVB4FxKctn4J6) territories seemed to be on the
rise. In a somewhat surprising move, [Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) [Yonis Ardishapur](4Tb1Uk75SycuFuiizODkZD) appointed an Ammatar imperial
civil servant, Ekroz Salaf, as new Governor of the Ammatar Mandate.
Perhaps a shrewd choice, the selection of an ethnic Ammatar buoyed up
the morale of an Ammatar population that had feared being totally
sidelined in favor of [True Amarr](2DkiJVfiL1RYP5y7AJGSNN) holders and
officials. The security of the Ammatar Mandate also seemed to be much
improved with the deployment of a new [Ammatar Fleet](3as0Qu7kajUNvkjJdBSwF1) security taskforce to the border with
the Minmatar Republic, together with the assembly of a new penal brigade
made up of disgraced Ammatar military personnel and pro-defection
civilians.

Blast and Purge
---------------

In the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy), a severe blast at a [Deep Core Mining Inc.](1H5H7H31pmuSXDnw1k6mvM) facility in Kaunokka
system killed 25 workers. DCMI workers blamed the blast on 'unbearable'
conditions and raised the possibility of a strike if conditions were not
improved. [Spacelane Patrol](4sFkyXcJF48IMnBrqv0Lot), the corporate
security force of DCMI majority shareholder [CBD Corporation](7o6AuVZhnq4lIzIMdYdMft), launched an investigation into
the Kaunokka incident but took only a day to issue a report that was
inconclusice and widely crticized. One aide to
Provist Director Suvasemi
Aikinen went so far as to condemn the Spacelane Patrol report as
"ridiculous." Under pressure and clearly wishing to maintain its good
relations with the Provists, the CBD Corporation embarked on
wide-ranging reorganization within DCMI and Spacelane Patrol. One
anonymous source described the reorganization as "a bloodbath" and told
of how anyone connected with the DCMI facility and the Spacelane Patrol
investigation was purged.

Election Season
---------------

The [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)'s presidential election
process began to get underway with various candidates announcing their
campaigns for the presidency. Senator Vilar Garioss of the Nexus
Constellation was the first to follow early candidate Jacus Roden with a
late October declaration of intend. Initial reactions to Senator
Garioss's candidacy were mixed but he was nonetheless a serious and
credible candidate. Rumours concerning the Governor of the Mies system,
Celes Aguard, were confirmed when the [Jin-Mei](6SFvK45QIlCCCoNODY3gUB)
politician announced her candidacy in a press conference at her
residence. Aguard played on her Jin-Mei heritage at a political rally
she held at the end of the month on the Chakaux planet in
[Lirsautton](4vX2JFJxrnpRAKUN8ZAO2L) system.
