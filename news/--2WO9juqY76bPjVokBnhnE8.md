**Frazov** was an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) with a military background marked by tattoos across his chest. He is considered to be an efficient sadist. When challenged by [Adron Srif](6qTwcVx73ngdPyee2fF5Lz) , he is believed to be the first to interpret the "no firearms" rule of the rite as permitting ranged weapons, which he used against Srif. When trapped, he revealed a fire-arm hidden in his prosthetic arm and killed Srif. He was then killed for breaking the rules of the rite.
