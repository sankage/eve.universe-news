Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/terran

**Terran** is a term used to refer to a hypothetical progenitor race
that colonized [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) prior to the
collapse of the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o). Little is known about
this race, though they left numerous artifacts across the cluster,
including old [stargates](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) and the EVE Gate itself.
