 **Jita, The Forge** \- An invasion of Providence by HYDRA RELOADED [HYDRA] is expected soon.  
  
Johan Moisander, diplomat for HYDRA revealed the scope of the planned attack: "Which system we attack first is irrelevant to be honest. We're going to attack all of Ushra'Khan's systems at the same time."  
  
HYDRA began as enemies of Curatores Veritatis Alliance [CVA] in their birthplace of Providence. With Providence now in hostile hands, HYDRA finds itself allied with CVA in order to take back what they feel is rightfully theirs.  
  
If they succeed in their operation, Johan says: "Our alliance will move into Providence. We will welcome pirate raiders. We will... camp gates in small gun Harbingers for hours like the olden days of Providence."  
  
CVA confirmed that they will be taking part in a mutual invasion of Providence along with HYDRA, with member Marcus Griffin stating that for CVA the invasion began the minute they lost sovereignty.  
  
CVA have different plans for Providence. Once finished they hope "Operation Deliverance" will be completed which will see the region made ready to be handed over to the Amarr Empire. What will become of the alliance between HYDRA and CVA will remain to be seen.
