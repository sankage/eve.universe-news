# Stun Baton
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/stun-baton

The **stun baton** is a larger, heavier version of the
[Z-Stick](3rLFUehxOmRFeRSeigjt5c) that delivers a crippling shock when
placed into contact with human skin. Unlike the Z, the effects last long
after physical contact with the device ceases. It can penetrate light
clothing, but is ineffective against body armor. The stun baton also
doubles as a blunt trauma delivery weapon.
