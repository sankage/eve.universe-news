 **C-J6MT, Insmother** \- Political clashes within Red Alliance [RA] may bring the Detorid/Insmother war to an abrupt end.[![C-J6MT Station Under Siege](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3144/raattackedthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3144%2Fraattacked.png)  
  
Talks are under way to decide whether RA will continue to defend Insmother or retreat to safer havens. Reports indicate a shift in leadership as the cause of political unrest inside the alliance.  
  
UaxDeath of Legions of xXDEATHXx described the atmosphere during the talks: _"It's like a nuclear strike ... CEO got kicked out!"_  
  
According to White Aero of Atlas, rumors of Red Alliance's disbanding are partially true and a cease fire is already in place. He explained _"We understand that they are 'reorganizing' and that some corps are leaving ... all RA pilots have been given a small window of time to [depart] Insmother with as much of their possessions as possible."_  
  
UaxDeath expects clashes against Atlas to continue in the future. He said _"We'll stay and fight... [it is] hard to say how many [pilots] we have lost ... [we'll see] in a couple of days."_  
  
Interstellar Correspondents will monitor the unfolding situation and report as soon as developments become available.
