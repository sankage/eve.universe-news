# Salvage Drones
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/salvage-drones

**Salvaging drones** are used to retrieve cargo and other items that
have been ejected by a destroyed spaceship. They cannot be used to
retrieve items from inside ships, though once one has been carved to
pieces they can take items from the wreckage.
