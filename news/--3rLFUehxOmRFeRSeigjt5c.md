# Z-Stick
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/z-stick

A **z-stick** is a small, concealable, pointer-like weapon that induces
a paralyzing, electro-chemical burst of nerve agents when placed into
contact with human skin. It works best when placed near the base of the
spine. The pain and paralysis disappear as soon as the weapon is
removed.
