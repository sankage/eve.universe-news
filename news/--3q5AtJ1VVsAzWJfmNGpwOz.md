Federation Military Review
--------------------------

The collapse of the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) [Federal Defense Union](5RoHHUZd3JdAg1HhBi5BAP) militia in the face of the
[Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) Offensive that swept to victory in the
first half of the year led to heavy and increasing criticism of the
[Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) and the FDU. In early
July, the Federation [Senate's](x8brOPuT22Bcly2Sikkt5) Defense Committee was
presented with a petition signed by many senators calling for an urgent
review of the FDU. Spearheaded by Senator Chermoul, a former colonel in
the Federation Navy marines, the petition contained the signatures of
many other senators and regional governors, particularly those connected
to Caldari-occupied areas of sovereign Federation space. Calling for the
competency of FDU commanders and the deployment of their assets to be
investigated, the petition was a strong challenge to the Federation's
defense establishment.

Even so, the Senate Defense Committee issued a preliminary report
indicating that it found "little to be concerned about" concerning the
FDU's administration. Senator Chermoul expressed the hope that this
preliminary finding was a true reflection on the FDU but pointed to the
plain fact that Federation space had been overrun by Caldari militia
forces. As the investigation into the FDU continued, an increase in the
intensity and pace of activity in the Federation Senate was evident,
reflecting the widespread concern over the Caldari victory in the
militia war zone. This concern was perhaps the impetus behind the
Federation Navy's liaison to the Senate Military Oversight department
engaging in his own parallel review of the FDU.

Whatever the case, the fact that the Navy was itself engaging in an
investigation while the Senate was carrying out its own review caused
considerable controversy. This controversy erupted in a heated session
of the Senate in which the authority of the Federation Navy to carry our
oversight functions with respect to the
[capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) militia was questioned severely. Some
analysts expressed outrage at the notion that the Federation Navy might
even take direct command authority over the FDU, something that would
threaten the limitations on warfare between the empires established by
the [CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act](39y03QDhd4N8GXwoV2zSha). Despite the
controversy over the FDU and the parallel reviews, the Senate was able
to pass a major new defense spending bill aimed at upgrading and
hardening the Federation's defense communications network.

The Konora Emergency
--------------------

In the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp), there were echoes of
the Skarkon Incident of [YC110](4s7KrRaqQANTatQhzlSaRi) with an apparent
[Angel Cartel](3p6aB4GMbVdMUEVYOb3kF0) intervention in the Konora
system. Beginning with unrest over food shortages in the system, linked
to the notorious [Great Wildlands](great-wildlands)
system of N-RAEL, the situation in Konora escalated after rioting in
which several people were killed. Using the situation as a pretext, an
Angel Cartel force led by a mysterious figure known as 'Commander
Origen' took control of the Konora system and its various mining and
industrial colonies under cover of distributing large supplies of food.
With the Minmatar Republic government concerned to act decisively,
[Sanmatar](180IYq6xQy0PzfGH6hLEuO) [Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV)
called an immediate conference of [Republic Fleet](2c4ZwKPnuW6mYkLJ2dGh94) commanders, including representatives
of a [Thukker Tribe](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z) military caravan.

The situation in Konora deteriorated sharply after the violent
suppression of pro-Republic protests on several of the colonies under
Angel control. Dozens were reported to have been killed by Angel troops
firing without warning on the protestors. Commander Origen claimed that
the action had been "necessary ... to quell the rioting" but in a
surprising development the Angel Cartel itself issued a statement
disavowing Origen's forces as "renegades" in breach of "Cartel law." At
the same time reports emerged of a battle between Angel Cartel forces
and apparent renegade vessels in the neighboring N-RAEL system.

The massacres that appeared to be taking place in Konora spurred the
Minmatar Republic on and within two days a joint Minmatar-Thukker task
force struck against the renegade Angels and drove them from Konora.
Many renegade ships were destroyed in system and there were reports of
fleeing renegades being engaged by Angel Cartel forces waiting in the
Great Wildlands. The fate of the enigmatic Commander Origen was never
established but it did emerge that the renegades had conspired with
Konora system officials to manipulate the situation and engineer the
food crisis in the first place. Interestingly, the Thukker military
forces involved were reported to have used a wormhole to insert their
forces into Konora and execute a surprise attack on the renegade's rear
echelon forces. The Konora Emergency was declared to be over by Sanmatar
Shakor's office a week after it had begun, laying to rest any comparison
with the handling of the Skarkon Incident.

Reform and Reaction
-------------------

In the Caldari State, the controversial
Provist Military Reforms
Act was finally passed by the [Chief Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr) despite opposition from the
[Hyasyoda](WisddAsk7hie3SUcwiNwa),
[Nugoeihuvi](4Ykng1Buej1uH3Sy5ln3jW) and
[Sukuuvestaa](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB) corporations. The
Patriot bloc backed reforms were passed with the support of the Ishukone
and [CBD]((../../new-eden/organizations/cbd-corporation) corporations. In essence, the
united "Patriot Three" were able to peel the Practical CBD and the
Liberal [Ishukone](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) away from their
respective factions, thereby undermining the opposition to the reforms.
The Ishukone move appeared to be motivated by the modernizing tendency
of the corporation and the concerns of their Navy veteran CEO Mens
Reppola. CBD's motives for breaking ranks with its fellow Practicals
were less clear but most observers attributed it to the corporation
wishing to distance itself from Nugoeihuvi following the controversial
incident in Uphallant.

In the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo), a controversy over transcranial
microcontrollers erupted in the wake of closer unity with the Khanid
Kingdom, where their use for slave control
was quite common. Some hardline Amarr traditionalist holders tried to
have a case banning the use of the devices heard by the [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk). The Council declined to hear it,
however, reaffirming that matters of slave control and discipline were
for individual [Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) within the broad framework
of the imperial and religious law. While the dispute prompted at least
one hardline Holder to move from the relatively liberal Tash-Murkon
domains to the increasingly orthodox Ammatar
Mandate, the major beneficiary of the
publicity appeared to be Ishukone Corporation. The transcranial
microcontroller manufacturer promptly offered bulk rate deals to all
interested Amarr Holders.

Jarek Slain
-----------

The month closed with the shocking news of killing of [Abel Jarek](5HDj1enu8OW6rTNg6d9dR8) in an attack on the Salvation Crusade
community in the lower Tronhadar region of [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6).
Jarek was killed during an attack by masked vigilantes on the township
'Salvation' he founded for his followers in the Tronhadar valley region
of Matar. The news spread quickly among the scattered Salvation Crusade
communities, inducing shock and disbelief among their number. Other
Minmatar converts to the Amarr faith expressed deep concern at the
killing. Initial indications that extremists from the [Krusual Tribe](7KI9OEieV9sdjksayCyoGk) may have organized the attack prompted
an investigation and co-operation with the government by the tribal
authorities but little was expected to come of it by way of catching and
punishing the killers.
