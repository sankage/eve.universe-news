Gallente President Souro Foiritan has pulled of a real coup by convincing Articio Kor-Azor to give up the Crielere scientists he recently bought. A deal was struck in the early hours of the morning after prolonged discussions between Federation diplomats and representatives of the royal heir. Details of this deal are still sketchy, but are thought to include trade and mining rights, tech exchange and intelligence cooperation. Early reports indicate that Articio may have overstepped the informal boundaries set by the Emperor regarding the extent of agreements Amarr citizens may make with foreigners, but the office of the Imperial Chamberlain declined to comment when contacted on the matter.   
  
The two scientists, the Gallentean Touvolle and Umailen the Caldari, are to be released in the next few days, as soon as the paperwork can be cleared up. The pair was sent to the newly erected research labs somewhere in the Kor-Azor region, but had not yet started work.
