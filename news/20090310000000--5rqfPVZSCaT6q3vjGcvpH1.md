SEYLLIN - In an apparent confirmation of New Eden's worst fears, the flotilla of rescue ships above Seyllin I has left orbit and are pushing towards the system's stargates. SCOPE News vessels attempting to defy system-wide evacuation orders were fired upon by Federation Navy warships. Before leaving the Seyllin System, SCOPE was able to confirm that no dropships remained at any of the spaceports.  
  
CONCORD warships have blockaded the entry points into Seyllin from the Aporulie, Ane, and Metserel Systems. SCOPE News will be unable to report on events on the far side until the blockade is lifted.
