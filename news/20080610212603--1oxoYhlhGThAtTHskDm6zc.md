Illuin – Scope News has just obtained confirmation of the mass-murder of hundreds of municipal and regional government officials and throughout the Minmatar Republic. The assassins, believed to be aligned with the same Minmatar-Thukker strike force invading the Amarr Empire, are allegedly leaving evidence of the victim’s complicity with Amarrian intelligence services with each corpse. This "purge", as the attackers have allegedly described, was clearly timed to coincide with the invasion. Police detectives have remarked that the Minmatar-Thukker operation was "flawless", leaving "no opportunity for police forces to react." 

The Republic Fleet still denies any involvement with the attackers, but has ordered all combat vessels to amass near the borders as a "precaution against any Amarrian counterstrike."
