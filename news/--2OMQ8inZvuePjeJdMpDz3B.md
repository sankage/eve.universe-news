# True Slaves
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/true-slaves

True Slaves are the main inhabitants of [Sansha's Nation](6dFZYDkE3R4BRF9w21mtjP). These True Slaves fill a variety of
functions, from custodial and other menial labors to serving as the
primary navy of the Nation. These True Slaves come primarily from
abducted populations, which are then fitted with Slave Implants. These
implants are highly advanced cybernetic control systems that completely
subvert the will of those implanted to that of Sansha Kuvakei and his
loyal commanders.

True Slaves have no will of their own and are often described as
"mindless" by outsiders. However, individuals can show varying degrees
of personality and freedom, depending on their personal predilections
toward to the Nation and task. Scouts, which approach settlements and
offer surrender terms, often appear much as they did before being fitted
with implants and retain a high degree of individuality. Similarly,
the commanders of Sansha fleets are allowed to retain their creativity
and decision-making skills, so as to more easily react to the rapidly
changing conditions of a battlefield.

Most True Slaves are kept in a form of hive-mind which constantly feeds
data between Sansha's central command and the individual slaves. This is
referred to as a direct feed, as everything the True Slave experiences
is sent back for analysis. Additionally, instructions can be broadcast
to the True Slaves, which they are compelled to follow.

It is incredibly difficult to remove Slave Implants once they have been
installed. After a certain time has passed, which differs from person to
person, a True Slave's individuality has been broken in such a way that
psychological recovery is highly unlikely and the process is therefore irreversible. These True Slaves desire only death, either in service of
[Sansha](17GtFlYwgztQDPD4Uotuv8) or by suicide, should they be freed
from their bonds.
