# Merimeth Sarum
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/merimeth-sarum

Merimeth Sarum is the current [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) [Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh)
of the [Sarum Family](4EZ4a3Mw8QXHmisAA4Ff6L), having been appointed to the seat in
YC 110 by his aunt, [Empress Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L), not long
after her ascension. During his rule, he has overseen the massive
reorganization of the House's bureaucracy following Jamyl I's
coronation, as well as the reconstruction of
[Mekhios](3VOfvlm6gGI0LRutDj5MhI), which was ravaged by the Elder Invasion
that same year. Touted to rule for centuries, Merimeth Sarum has spent
the relatively short time since his appointment asserting his authority
over his new domains.

Early Life
----------

Merimeth was born in YC 49 in [Sarum Prime](uO7T7UMc6L0S8OUcHJJqP), on
the Family headquarters station. As just another face amongst his
countless peers, Merimeth was not expected to amount to much. His
parents were serving captains within the Sarum House fleet, and he did
not have much contact with them as a result. Instead, he established a
close familial relationship with his aunt, Jamyl Sarum, almost acting as
a surrogate mother until his adolescence.

Adult Education & Career
------------------------

As a noble in the militant Sarum Family, there was considerable pressure
for Merimeth to join the Imperial Navy as an officer. In YC 67, he
attended [Hedion University](32yJYVHiayBqLEZq4ulJrd) to study
theology, a common and mostly unremarkable path. He graduated four years
later with top honors, finding a job for the
[Ministry of Internal Order](5P4c9Lcr1rAUNd2Lb8gb3t) instead of the Navy,
though his status as a noble and somewhat of a favorite to Jamyl meant
that he was exclusively confined to administrative and bureaucratic work
for the first few years of his career. Like many nobles, however,
Merimeth was able to rise the ranks quickly, becoming an operations
coordinator by his fortieth birthday. The influence he wielded through
the MIO was able to transfer handsomely to his standing within the Sarum
Family, where he was consulted often for internal security purposes
across Upper Domain. It is rumoured that, during the latter years of
Emperor [Heideran VII's](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV) rule, he assisted aunt
Jamyl considerably during her secret machinations to ensure her victory
in the upcoming Succession Trials.

As Heir Apparent
----------------

In [YC 105](7fPQjSvh0UicNGNdh3nVkd), when Jamyl Sarum committed
[suicide](7uCmeRGL3bgVWlEWQ9TZQb) after her failure to win the
[Succession Trials](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx), she did not name an
Heir. Instead, senior Family members decided to elect Merimeth as heir
apparent. Merimeth was extremely reluctant, despite the leadership
qualities displayed during his career as a senior Ministry of Internal
Order official. He was grateful for only being named heir apparent as,
in secret, the House elders were fully aware that Jamyl was not truly
deceased.

Under new Emperor [Doriam II](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT), Merimeth followed
the lead of other Heirs, especially considering his relatively younger
age severely stifling any prospect of striking out on his own. During
this time, the inexperienced Merimeth was merely a puppet of senior
Sarumites. When Doriam II was assassinated, Merimeth was kept in
uncomfortable suspension by [Court Chamberlain](4cstqCKrXLAu5XDiqztSe6)
[Dochuta Karsoth's](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL) policy of delaying any
attempts to resolve the question of the Imperial Throne. Nonetheless, he
felt humiliated at remaining nothing more than an Heir apparent, and
thus willingly made himself the face of his Sarum relatives' unfaltering
opposition to Karsoth.

During the Elder War and [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) invasion of
Sarum Prime, Merimeth assisted in the defense of Mekhios, under House
Steward [Pomik Haromi](7JF50RSNrYSXLkUmingcwS), who had been appointed
to command by the suddenly-returned Jamyl. With little military
experience, Merimeth was believed not capable of taking charge of the
realm's defense. Not long after the return of his aunt., Merimeth's
status would be sealed for good.

As Heir
-------

In October YC 110, Empress Jamyl I confirmed that her nephew Merimeth
Sarum would be the Royal Heir of the Sarum Family. Merimeth said that he
was "honored to accept the responsibility, and impatient to begin
his duties." His first actions as Heir was facilitating the
reconstruction of Sarum Prime and other House territories that were
ravaged by the Elder battle. The hasty seizing of this glaring
opportunity earned him much popular support, though his activities as a
Sarumite would remain eclipsed by that of his aunt. When the Empress
announced her historic emancipation of ninth generation slaves and
above, Merimeth was notably iron-fisted in ensuring that all Holders
under his domain complied with the order.

Now with the relative return of stability to the Amarr Empire, Merimeth
Sarum has spent his time so far as Royal Heir asserting his rule over
his dominion, visiting central worlds and distant planets alike. With a
Sarum family member as sovereign, Merimeth must often live in the shadow
of his aunt. Combined with the fact that he is relatively young compared
to the other heirs, Merimeth has been extremely active in seeking to
prove himself capable for authority. So far, the nobles of the Empire
agree he has been serving his role more than sufficiently.
