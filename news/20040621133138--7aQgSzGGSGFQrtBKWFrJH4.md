# Tal-Romon Cathedral Begins Its Journey

Over the past couple of days, the first transports have begun arriving over Amarr Prime, carrying bricks of the Tal-Romon Cathedral from its original site on Eclipticum. Dismantling the ancient cathedral and storing the bricks and relics for transport has taken longer than expected, with the Theology Council insisting on constant inspections to ensure full precautions were taken.   
  
First brought into the limelight by Articio Kor-Azor's revelry, the cathedral of the patron saint of adventurers and wanderers was purchased by Catiz Tash-Murkon. Her plans to restore the site and open it to the public sparked a great public outcry and ultimately Doriam II intervened, confiscating the cathedral. In what has been seen as a move to distance himself from the actions of his son, he ordered the cathedral to be moved to Amarr Prime where it would be reconstructed and reconsecrated on the Amarr continent itself. Catiz Tash-Murkon has been unusually silent since then but reports are surfacing of an unusual number of pilots performing independent contract work for the Tash-Murkon family in Tash-Murkon Prime.   
  
A representative from the Imperial Chancellor today announced that all Amarrian pilots that wish to assist in the relocation effort report to the Kor-Azor Family Bureau around Eclipticum. When asked about the rumors of some shipments failing to arrive at their final destination, he declined to comment.
