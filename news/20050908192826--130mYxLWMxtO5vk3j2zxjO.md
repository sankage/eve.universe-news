Vincent Aslo, the eccentric ex-host of the popular Gallente TV show "What's That Holoreel" has recently begun a new event. "Beat The Tank!", as he calls it, involves challengers attempting to beat his Raven's shield tank setup.  
  
Aslo, a very rich and adventurous young man, is famous for his frivolous expenditure and loves to entertain his adoring fans. The first winner of "Beat The Tank!", Spikum, earned himself two million isk and with more rounds of "Beat The Tank!" planned, as well as several more events in the works, it looks like Vincent Aslo's penchant for entertainment knows no limits.
