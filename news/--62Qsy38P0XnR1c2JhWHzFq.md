# Kor-Azor Prime
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/kor-azor-prime

Kor-Azor Prime is the capital system of the [Kor-Azor Family](1S0FEGgzJiwc4yXaG5AzjD).
It is in the Kor-Azor region and,
at one jump from [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4), is (along with
[Sarum Prime](uO7T7UMc6L0S8OUcHJJqP)) the closest of the
[Heir's](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) capital systems to the
[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) home world. The system contains five planets;
one temperate, one oceanic, one barren, and two gas giants.

Discovery and Exploration
-------------------------

Kor-Azor was known to the ancient Amarr, though in the whole it was an
unimportant star. It is visible without a telescope, though it is not
particularly bright in the night sky compared with closer, larger stars.

Physically, the system is 7.714 light years away from the Amarr home
system, meaning it was not one of the first to be visited and explored.
It took hundreds of years between the opening of the first
[stargate](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) to Hedion before a gate was constructed
to Kor-Azor. The system seemed rather uninteresting at first glance,
though its connection to Amarr made it a valuable commodity.

The rising Kor-Azor Family was given control of the system. The family
began to settle on the sole temperate world and began to build their
strength. As was expected, the existence of a stargate from Amarr to the
system made it valuable to traders, who would otherwise require a quite
circuitous route to reach deeper systems. This quickly raised the
profile of the system and made the Kor-Azor Family incredibly powerful
over time.

During the Elder Invasion, the system was heavily hit by the [Elder Fleet](7JAFwYwGqzvPv7yLIDlfjp). A local station was heavily damaged
and planets were invaded by [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) troops.

Sun
---

Today, the system's sun is known as "the Kor-Azor Star", though prior to
the rise of the Kor-Azor Family, it was named "Katari". It is a
relatively cool yellow subdwarf star. It has a surface temperature of
5274 K and an equatorial radius of 184400 km. It is roughly 4.25 billion
years old, making it a middle-aged star. Combined with its relatively
small size, the star is expected to be stable and maintain habitable
worlds for several billion years.

Inner Planets
-------------

### Kor-Azor Prime I

Thanks to its star's small size and its lack of atmosphere, the first
planet in the system maintains a relatively low mean temperature.
Dayside temperatures can rise to 700 K, but much of the heat is radiated
away at night, when temperatures can dip close to 80 K.

The planet is barren and rocky, blasted by solar radiation and lacking
much in the way of habitable areas. A few research and mining stations
dot its surface, but no permanent settlements have been made.

### Kor Azor-Prime II

A relatively unremarkable oceanic world, Kor-Azor Prime II is the
second-most inhabited planet in the system. Several large, domed cities
exist beneath its waves. As it sits comfortably in the habitable zone of
the system, it has developed an extensive biosphere. Numerous aquatic
species call the planet home, including one highly intelligent but
short-lived species of mollusc that has been used extensively in
laboratory tests on animal problem-solving abilities.

Perhaps most important is the abundance of a species of kelp that is
high in nutrients. The kelp will grow in foreign waters, but only
thrives in its native biome, making the planet the only major source.
The kelp is used in several popular dishes, as well as in nutritional
supplements.

### Kor-Azor Prime III

A small, compact, visually bland icy gas giant, the system's third
planet nevertheless provides an important source of helium-2 and other
fuels. The planet is an almost uniform chalky-gray color, with little in
the way of bands or storm spots.

Deep within the planet, however, hides several more interesting
features. The middle of the planet is quite warm, which contrasts
strongly with the cool outer layers. This inner layer is wracked by some
of the most intense storms in the cluster. A non-convective layer
separates the inner and outer atmospheres, causing the planet to be of
scientific interest. Several research stations float precariously in the
non-convective layer to monitor the inner layer. Occasionally, accidents
have caused these stations to plunge into the storms below, never to be
heard from again.

Outer Planets
-------------

### Eclipticum

The fourth planet in the system is the sole temperate world and is the
capital of the Kor-Azor Family. Despite being over 7 AU from the
system's star, the planet has a thick atmosphere that keeps it warm and
comfortable at a mean temperature of 286 K. The planet has nearly as
much land cover as ocean, with small seas and large landmasses, many of
which are connected by thin land-bridges. It is, in fact, possible to
walk from one of the planet's poles to another, only rarely crossing a
man-made bridge.

The planet has an extremely long year, taking nearly ten
[Universal Standard](2cJeP2eBHll85PfjQlTtHt) years to make one orbit around its
sun. This has led to an extremely unusual biosphere. Native lifeforms
tend to live in cycles, with one species dominating an area for the warm
seasons and another dominating for the cold seasons. Very few species
remain active year-round.

As the capital of the Kor-Azor Family, the planet tends to serve more as
an administrative world than an economically productive one. The heir of
the family holds court from his palace, which has massive bronze doors
currently adorned with imagery of [Doriam II's](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT)
reign.

The planet remains a fairly important trade hub, with valuable goods
from across the cluster purchasable on its surface.

The planet underwent a brief decline when [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV)
first assumed power of the
Family, as his erratic ways drove away business and trade. However,
following his punishment at the hands of [Brother Joshua](3GdUiafeRMQKdpzDb8CWnJ),
the planet has recovered.

During the Elder War, Eclipticum was one of the first planets targeted
by the Elder Fleet. Kor-Azor Family security forces fought in defense of
the planet until [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) arrived with
[Naval](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g) forces to drive out the invaders.

Until recently, the planet had a different name. Following Doriam II's
victory at the [Amarr Championships](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx), he
renamed the planet Eclipticum in honor of his champion, Ecliptical.
Similarly, the planet's moons were renamed in honor of his wingmen. This
is believed to be the only planet in the cluster officially named after
a capsuleer.

### Kor-Azor Prime V

Colder than its fellow gas giant in the system, the fifth planet in
Kor-Azor Prime is also much more colorful. It has several bands of
grays, browns, and yellows, with a few small storms visible sweeping
through its atmosphere. Unlike its fellow gas giant, the planet is
unremarkable scientifically. There are some gas harvesting outposts, but
the planet is otherwise mostly ignored.
