Ratillose - Forces loyal to Amarr Heir Uriam Kador are being routed in what is being described as an "epic" counterattack by Federation Navy forces, and are reportedly outnumbered by a factor of almost 4:1. The military action follows an unprovoked invasion of the Gallente Federation just under an hour ago and emphatically described as "unsanctioned" by the Amarr Ministry of War. Scope News has confirmed that no Imperial reinforcements have arrived to support Kador's fleet. We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.
