[Orsetta Lexmoreau](6X2MS3haT7Ufi8eTAlpilz) is a research agent
working for [CreoDron](3lCriaLYr0Nrmj9pkru5Z3) at [Atlulle III](2Jtkm8UAtWTObh0P1SkFi2). She was one of several research agents
from corporations who [Trevor Kekkonen](2WqL1GocE2qDpqPQnb9Iv3)
commissioned to assist him in finding the answers he needed. She, like
the rest of the research agents under his employ, carried out the bulk
of the experiments and research required to test his theories. Though
Orsetta and her team were dedicated to their work and brilliant
scientists, they required constant financial and logistical support to
keep up with the workload imposed on them by Kekkonen.
