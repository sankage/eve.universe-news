MALKALEN - Mens Reppola, Ishukone Watch CEO, spoke to reporters at Ishukone's Malkalen headquarters, telling them that he had spoken to President Foiritan and offered any assistance he could render. "This is not a Federation problem, this is an international tragedy," said Reppola. "While Ishukone has no assets in the Thoulde constellation itself, our facilities elsewhere in Essence and Sinq Laison have been ordered to accept secondary casualties and refugees in the coming hours and days."
