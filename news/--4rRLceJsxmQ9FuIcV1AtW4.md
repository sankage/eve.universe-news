**Pekki Mataken**, a sector manager for the [Kaalakiota Corporation](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK), is one of the big
company employees who is known for his willingness to dabble a little on
the side with freelancers.

Residing in the Saatuban system, an economic nexus for the surrounding
systems, he has established a reputation for offering fair and
prosperous trade deals to those close with the KK. And those that find
favor with the shrewd [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) can expect to be
offered a chance to link up with people even higher in the corp's
hierarchy. But in the same vein, those who deal unfairly with him
quickly lose his favor and find themselves out in the cold.
