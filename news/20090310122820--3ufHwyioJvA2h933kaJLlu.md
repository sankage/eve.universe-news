AMARR - An official communique from the office of Aritcio Kor-Azor has offered assistance to the Gallente Federation.  
  
"Empress Jamyl I has ordered the Empire to stand by in offering aid to the Federation at this difficult time. Regardless of the differences between our nations, at a time like this it is only right for us to provide assistance. Natural phenomena are the work of God, and we see this as a test of our faith and our intentions. Amarr will not fail this test."  
  
The Amarr Navy have placed the fleet recently removed from Kador's direct control on thirty minutes' notice to move, with the order to remain inside Amarr sovereign space awaiting an official response from President Foiritan.
