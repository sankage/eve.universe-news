Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/bryld

**Bryld** is a seven-year old [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) child living on [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6). His father is an engineer.

Bryld enjoys playing with ChromIts, a popular children's toy. He is a bright child who, when first encountered, had been working on a particular ChromIt sculpture for two weeks. The sculpture was of a wireframe hulk, a device his father was designing that would help tow disabled starships without destroying them.

[Sadrede Svarg](3SX4vUKoA6WJlXGrb9vIDl) expressed amazement that a seven-year old would be capable of making such a thing, but [Aduner Hulmkelat](4y6T5MA4qy4Kn4NvbJUW8e) noted that Bryld used hot joining and glue to make the sculpture, rather than the more difficult cold joining technique he had first appeared to be employing.
