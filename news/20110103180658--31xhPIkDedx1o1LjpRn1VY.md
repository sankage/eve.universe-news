 **Amarr Prime, Domain** \- To celebrate the start of year 113, capsuleers have been invited to give and trade away unwanted items at [New Year Markets](http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1439681) to be hosted by CCP Zymurgist.   
  
CCP Zymurgist hosted a 'Swap Meet' last year which apparently saw very little trouble; pirates appeared to prefer to attend the event than ambush those on their way to it, but nonetheless, pilots are advised to move any large quantities of goods in advance and to exercise all normal precautions.   
  
New Year Markets will take place in Amarr, Dodixie, and Rens on 09.01.113 at 19:00 New Eden Standard Time.
