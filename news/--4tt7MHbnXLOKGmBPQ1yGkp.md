August, YC111
=============

Minmatar Converts and Gallente Turmoil
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As August opened, Minmatar converts to the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
faith continued to express deep concerns over the killing of [Abel Jarek](5HDj1enu8OW6rTNg6d9dR8). [Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2) and
[Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) believers were particularly vocal in
pressing for adequate political representation for themselves and other
Minmatar converts. The incident's ramifications appeared very wide
indeed when [Sanmatar](180IYq6xQy0PzfGH6hLEuO)
[Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV) announced that the Tribal Assembly
was to be delayed for some months due to the returned tribes needing
"more time" to prepare themselves. While the outstanding issue of tribal
chiefs needing to be appointed for both tribes was the clearest reason
for the delay, some saw the divisive issue of Minmatar belief in the
Amarr religion as an additional factor.

The Gallente Senate continued to experience turbulence as the outspoken
Senator Chermoul bowed to political reality and withdrew his petition
regarding the review of the FDU militia. At the same time a head of
steam was building up behind a movement to curtail the powers of [Mentas Blaque](1bZzUGejHEhyHp6LVUtjBT), seen by many to be in a conflict of
interests due to his role as both a Senator and Director of the
[FIO's](4Q7sdriIYVeeQANNNXF0nH) Special Department of
Internal Investigations- the so-called [Black Eagles](6eVk3icIk4UHf5Uh799xDN). By the second week of August, Senators
were openly calling for Blaque to resign from his FIO position and
warning of a descent 'into totalitarianism.'

Caldari Memorandum and Gallente Crisis
--------------------------------------

The turmoil in the Federation [Senate](x8brOPuT22Bcly2Sikkt5) was totally
overshadowed by a leaked memorandum from the Caldari Providence
Directorate to the
[Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) corporations offering "development and
exploration rights" in Federation systems occupied by the Caldari for
auction to the highest bidders. The memorandum was dated mid-July and
the hitherto secret auction was to end on 111.08.21. The startling
revelation that the Caldari State had gone so far as to begin selling
development rights in the occupied systems caused a sharp drop on the
Gallente stock market, with corporations located or heavily-invested in
the occupied areas suffering very large losses of share price.

If the Gallente markets reacted adversely to new of the rights auction,
the Federation government, and [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E) [Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) in particular, reacted forcefully
by issuing an executive mandate nationalizing Gallente arms
manufacturers under the [Hueromont](1PzpjLA0ZHtQRZu2f8x4gO) Act, a measure
dating from the First [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV) and not invoked since. This caused
immediate outrage in the Senate with the act decried as an "impeachable
offense," and Senators convening an emergency session to respond to the
decree. With the Hueromont Act giving the President powers to by-pass
the Senate and directly control the armaments industry of the Federation
regardless of corporate law, it had always been regarded as an emergency
measure to be used in extraordinary circumstances. Its invocation
therefore suggested that the Federation itself was in a state of
emergency.

Meanwhile, on Intaki Prime the already deeply concerned citizenry were
thrown into a state of panic at news of the Provist memorandum.
[Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn) police and planetary defense troops were
deployed in large numbers to keep the peace and prevent new eruptions of
rioting between pro-Federation and pro-State protestors. The Intaki
assembly went so far as to promise to make any 'transition as smooth as
possible,' a declaration that appeared to represent a total surrender to
the Caldari occupation and resignation to the prospect of Intaki being
sold to the highest bidder. The status and possible fate of the many
Federation troops stationed on the planet was perhaps the most worrying
issue, with some noting the heavy bombardment of Federation military
bases that had taken place on [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i).

The Federation Senate convened to chaotic scenes as it first tried to
deal with the bill to reform the separation of powers and forbid any
person from holding both executive and legislative posts. The customary
decorum of Senate meetings fractured under the tensions of the political
situation and it was reported that name-calling and shouting
deteriorated into attempted physical violence resembling 'a schoolyard
brawl.' The inability of the Senate to come to order prompted Senator
Mentas Blaque in his role as Head of the Senate to close the session
early and table the matter for reconsideration the next day. Given that
the bill itself was a more or less naked attack on Blaque himself, some
considered that his action was further evidence of his heavy-handed
approach to the Gallente democracy.

Roden Resists
-------------

It may well have been that some Senators were glad not to have been tied
up with the reform bill for the remainder of the day given the situation
with the Hueromont Act. Sensationally, news emerged of [Roden Shipyards](7rQ0lltCUepPHdEJLSC9gQ) refusing to comply with the
executive decree on nationalization. It was reported that Roden security
forces and FIO agents were in a stand-off after Roden Shipyards founder
[Jacus Roden](1ijjvREo0tNCQD1EKlUa5z) personally refused to allow the
agents to enter Roden facilities. The Roden position was that President
Foiritan had no legal authority to invoke the Heuroment Act in the
circumstances and therefore none to commandeer the operations of Roden
Shipyards. This news gave fresh momentum to those senators working to
achieve a majority for holding an impeachment hearing against Souro
Foiritan.

Within the hour of Roden Shipyard's example, Federation arms
manufacturers collectively refuted the right of the President to mandate
nationalization, with twelve of the largest Gallente corporations
signing a charter refusing to comply with the Hueromont Act. At the same
time, the Federation Senate voted by a two-to-one margin to begin
impeachment proceedings against President Foiritan. The Federal
Intelligence Office agents tasked with enforcing the decree were swiftly
ordered to stand down at the direction of Mentas Blaque.

The Fall of Souro Foiritan
--------------------------

The swift collapse of the Foiritan administration's nationalization
policy, and the impending impeachment hearings, evidently crystallized
the issue of his authority as Federation President for Souro Foiritan.
Within two days it was being widely reported that he was to resign and
call for fresh elections. Sure enough, President Foiritan addressed the
Gallente Federation and formally announced his resignation. Calling for
elections to be held in November, Foiritan's statement included an
admission that his decision to invoke the Hueromont Act was 'wrong' but
taken by him in good faith as a response to the situation in the
Caldari-occupied systems. He had retracted the order and would continue
to operate the government at full capacity until the newly-elected
president took office.

Observers took the view that the failure of the [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) and FDU to oppose the Caldari
offensive, combined with the earlier betrayals of Admiral [Alexander Noir](7yGm9JcjjD577R4fjG6D4t) and Grand Admiral [Anvent Eturrer](4ft267N4XjELE5by1uHCt5), would mark the Foiritain presidency
as one in which the Gallente armed forces declined and even lost overall
control of the security of the Federation. For his part, Jacus Roden
declared his candidacy for the presidency within days of Foiritan's
resignation announcement. The reclusive capsuleer industrialist, founder
of Roden Shipyards and leader of the corporate rebellion against the
Hueromont Act, ranked as one of the richest individuals in the
Federation and his role in Foiritan's fall seemed likely to stand him in
good stead on the campaign trail.

The Fate of Intaki Prime
------------------------

The tensions on Intaki Prime were graphically illustrated when farming
community on the planet became embroiled in an armed confrontation with
Intaki police forces. Concerned at rumors that the Provist auction
memorandum indicated that their lands would be seized and sold off to
Caldari megacorps, the Intaki farmers had acquired large numbers of
weapons and explosives and sealed off their town, intending to "stand
against the invasion." Intaki police forces were called out to deal with
the situation and relieve the farmers of their weapons, many of which
seemed to be illegal or stolen.

As the stand-off teetered perilously on the brink of violence, news
emerged that the Intaki system development rights being auctioned by the
Caldari Providence Directorate had been acquired by [Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI). Unusually, it was
reported that Intaki was the only occupied system for which Ishukone had
acquired such rights. Whether this news had any impact on the farmers or
not is unclear but within hours the stand-off had ended peacefully with
the weapons given up but their homes and farmland remaining in their
possession for the time being.

By the end of the month, the Caldari Providence Directorate had released
the official list of systems in the auction and the corporations winning
the development rights in each system. The sheer wealth and reach of the
Big 8 megacorporations drove even relatively wealthy sub-megacorp
entities, such as [Ytiri](5Ct6qvG5ryJZOQxfA2zbIS), out of the running and all
of the Big 8 had at least one successful bid. The powerful [Sukuuvestaa Corporation](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB) claimed 14 systems in
the auction while it was confirmed that Ishukone had indeed bid for and
acquired rights only in Intaki system. The long-term consequences of the
development rights auction remained unclear, but the involved
corporations were noted to already be moving assets into place to
commence exploitations of their new acquisitions.
