June, YC111
===========

Empire and Kingdom
------------------

On the first of June, King [Khanid II](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf) departed
Tash-Murkon Prime with the [Khanid Royal 1st Fleet](nQJFwBFQzGij9cZKKCrm7) and arrived shortly thereafter in
the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) system. Following on his week spent with
the [Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) [Catiz Tash-Murkon](5sw0sEytwzlBUbKWdiisUI), events appeared to be moving
according to a careful diplomatic plan. The next day,
[Empress](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L)
met with Khanid II in the Imperial city of
[Dam-Torsad](UI6KVmdCZ0H42EvHijFVZ), with this being the first time in
500 years that the Khanid leader had set
foot on [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4). In the hallowed precincts
of the holy city, the Empress summoned all Royal Heirs of the Amarr
Empire to an extraordinary session of the full [Privy Council](privy-council). As the last occasion that a full
meeting in person of the Privy Council, had preceded the coronation of
Empress Jamyl I herself, and given the rarity of such meetings, it was
clear that significant developments in the politics and diplomacy of the
Amarr Empire were in the offing.

After several days of closed meetings, the Royal Heir [Yonis Ardishapur](4Tb1Uk75SycuFuiizODkZD) was reported to have abruptly
departed the Privy Council's deliberations, apparently to tend to "vital
matters" within the Ardishapur domains. While there was some speculation
as to this unusual absence from the ongoing meeting, the [Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) issued an official statement to
the effect that Arim Ardishapur was speaking "with the full authority of
the Ardishapur Family" at the meeting and claimed that "the Empress
had given full permission for Lord Ardishapur to leave the meeting."

Whatever the reason for Ardishapur's departure, the Heir was to return
the next day and join with the Empress and other Privy Council members
as Empress Jamyl I made another of the surprising announcements that
were fast becoming the hallmark of her reign. Addressing the Amarr
Empire from the steps of the Imperial Palace in Dam-Torsad, the Empress
announced that the Khanid Kingdom and the Amarr Empire were now once
more unified, with the Khanid region designated as a "Kingdom of the
Empire" to be ruled in the name of "Holy Amarr" by Khanid II.

As a mark of this union and the return of Khanid II to the imperial
fold, the Empress granted [House Khanid](1dQRsN9IAaCTVkatH4haam) a
seat on the Privy Council in perpetuity. A diplomatic and political deal
of some subtlety, the new union between the Empire and Kingdom left the
right of Jamyl I to rule as Empress of Amarr without challenge while
ensuring the autonomy and independence of Khanid II's territories within
the imperial framework. One notable point was that the Khanid seat on
the Privy Council did not bring with it Royal Heir status, possibly a
compromise necessary to secure the agreement of the Royal Heirs to the
extraordinary rapprochement with a man once reviled within the Empire as
a traitor, heretic and renegade.

Reactions to the new unity of the Amarr Empire and Khanid Kingdom were
in many ways as would be expected. [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)
commentators saw the formal reconciliation as a highly positive step
which could prove to be a profitable opportunity for Caldari
corporations with links to both the Kingdom and the Empire. In the
[Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK), academics and other
observers of interstellar politics saw it as a worrying development that
could only strengthen the Amarr-Caldari axis and lead to increased
exchange of technology and intelligence between the Amarr, Khanid and
Caldari. Most voices among the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) political
and military establishment tended to dismiss the new unity as "business
as usual," pointing out that the Amarr and Khanid had long collaborated
against Minmatar interests. However some, like the Gallente, highlighted
the increased potential for locking the Caldari into an anti-Minmatar
alliance due to their strong links with the Khanid.

Caldari Military and Militia
----------------------------

 In the Caldari State
itself, military matters loomed large in the news. A serious incident
the previous month, involving the destruction of civilian convoy in
Uphallant system by [Internal Security](3F5YslD2GfQXvpQPq3EGui),
[Nugoeihuvi's](4Ykng1Buej1uH3Sy5ln3jW) security arm, had
highlighted problems with communication and co-ordination in the Caldari
occupied zone of Gallente systems. The [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) had subsequently been reported as
over-stretched and finding it difficult to adequately patrol the vast
new territories under their control. These factors gave new impetus to
the Caldari Providence
Directorate's military
reform proposals in mid-June.

In particular, the embarrassing incident involving Nugoeihuvi's Internal
Security paramilitary force had led the other Practical faction
megacorps, [CBD](7o6AuVZhnq4lIzIMdYdMft) and
[Sukuuvestaa](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB), to back away from
their previously strong support for NOH's opposition to the reforms. The
Patriot bloc of megacorporations were also reported to be hoping to
appeal to [Ishukone](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) CEO Mens Reppola's
loyalty to the Caldari Navy as a means to overcome his own objections to
Provist policy in this area. With Caldari State Executor [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG) awarding the entire Caldari [State Protectorate](2VlyV0CDyxFv0Qg3N3dW8k) militia with the
Distinguished Blade, a national medal of recognition for their
successful offensive against the Gallente, it was certainly true that
the Provists could make a strong case for the Caldari military being
safe under their policies.

CORPS
-----

One other notable event at the end of June was the decision by
[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) to release the first declassified CONCORD
Outer Region Political Summary (CORPS) briefing to the public GalNet.
CORPS had been a regular bi-monthly declassified report produced by the
Directive Enforcement Department ([DED](1xZoOUsqaDhJw7gQffHMFC)) for Assembly
heads of state, internal watch commanders and diplomats for some time.
It release, planned to continue as the norm in future, appeared to be
part of a new transparency and publicity drive by an organization that
had seemed somewhat sidelined since the start of militia warfare between
the core empires.
