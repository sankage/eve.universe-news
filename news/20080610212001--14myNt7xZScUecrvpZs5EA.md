Yulai â€“ *** This is a breaking news story *** The Minmatar-Thukker armada has opened fire on CONCORD Bureau Station and on the Directive Enforcement Division ships defending it. The station is reportedly taking heavy damage from dozens of dreadnoughts as smaller escorts engage CONCORD warships directly. Eyewitnesses were reporting "massive" casualties on both sides before their transmissions were jammed at the source. This is a breaking news story that we will continue to update as more information becomes available.
