Sarum Prime - *** This is a breaking news report *** Scope News has obtained visual confirmation that the Elder fleet over Mekhios has been destroyed. Camera feeds restored following the potent detonation revealed thousands of wrecks littering a vast area of space over the planet, some of which has fallen into dangerously low orbit. Battles in major cities, most notably the capital of Xerah, have turned in favor of Amarrian defenders as Elder infantrymen are hunted down. 

The presence of Jamyl Sarum just moments before the explosion has yet to be confirmed, and no trace of her or her escort ships was spotted near the wreckage.
