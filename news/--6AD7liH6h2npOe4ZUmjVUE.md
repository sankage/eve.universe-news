# Plasma Weapons
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/plasma-weapons

A **plasma rifle** is an automatic charge-firing rifle whose charge
munitions are typically composed of lead and use a cyclotronic firing
mechanism.

Characteristics
---------------

All variants project magnetic containment bottles up to their targets
for the plasma to travel in. Because of this, plasma rifles do not have
long ranges, make inadequate sniping rifles, and are extremely
vulnerable to EMP countermeasures. These are power-intensive weapons.

Evolution
---------

First generation rifles required separate battery and ammunition clips
to operate; second generation rifles recycle the energy used in the
solid-state-to-plasma conversion to power the magnetic bottle
projection.

Manufacture
-----------

These weapons are produced by [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) and
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) arms manufacturers. Examples include the
[Gistii-10](2UlqIcYX7i31sqoZSHz6N6) and the [pithum-2 Automatic](4jyYkSis6CjU9D1D8akQao).
