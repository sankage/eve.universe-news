**Keeler** is a [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) boy on
[Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i). During the retaking of the
planet by the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy), he discovered a wounded
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) soldier. Keeler learned things are not
always as black and white as his parents' arguments about their future
would have had him believe. The next day the man was captured and
reported to be a murderer.
