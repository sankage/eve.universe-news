Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/nefantar

The **Nefantar** is the name of one of the seven [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) tribes. Coming to be known as [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) during the years of [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) rule, the name Nefantar has now been reclaimed by those returning to the Republic in the wake of the [Elder Fleet](7JAFwYwGqzvPv7yLIDlfjp) Invasion.
