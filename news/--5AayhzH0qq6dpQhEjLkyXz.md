**Carla** was the daughter of [Fermar](7cLMQC182YuCCSfazxcPbY). She was taken by the [Sansha](53mEByew2BMbNSMcjG7Ky7), possibly from the [Old Colony](7F4mXQ0x2Q4fCORw8MKm3W), and probably made into a [True Slave](6dFZYDkE3R4BRF9w21mtjP). Her father orchestrated a plan to put her out of her misery by setting a trap to completely destroy the raiding party she was a part of.
