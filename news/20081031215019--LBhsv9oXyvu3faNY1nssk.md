The Northern Coalition forces destroyed a second Avatar class Titan in Obe.

Obe was the scene of another Greater BoB Community vs. Northern Coalition battle yesterday. Pod pilots present at this battle numbered about half of those active at the E-OGL4 battles, but the Northern Coalition deployed a much larger percentage of dreadnoughts than in previous engagements. The dreadnought-heavy composition of the fleet allowed the Northern Coalition to destroy a second BoB Titan in less than a week.

More information will be posted as it becomes available.
