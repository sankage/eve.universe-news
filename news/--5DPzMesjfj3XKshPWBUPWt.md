## CONCORD Assembly

The Consolidated Cooperation and Relations Command Assembly, or CONCORD Assembly as it has become known, was founded over a century ago, after the five empires initially established contact with each other.

From the outset interstellar relations were strained. That being the case, the main purpose of an agency like CONCORD was to ease the tension and create a foundation for peaceful cooperation between the empires. This endeavor is widely regarded as a success, given that while several flare-ups have occurred, and indeed the empires have come to blows since CONCORDâ€™s formation, a situation of all-out war has been avoided through careful mediation and negotiation.
