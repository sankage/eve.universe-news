# Veniel
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/veniel

Veniel was a [Jovian](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) member of the [Society of Conscious Thought](5dFqRGejzFToa1MwNTN1G1) who was in
semi-regular contact with [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt). Believed by the
DED to be a Jove maverick and in association with [Admiral Ouria](2Og5aR1ZiiVEYPgx9FJcPg) - who Veniel referred to, possibly in
figurative fashion, as a brother - his appearance was usually followed
by events with significant repercussions, even after Ouria's death.

He was involved in alerting CONCORD to the Immensea Incident.
