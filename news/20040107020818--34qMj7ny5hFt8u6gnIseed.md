# Sell Orders returned, Yulai>Amarr gate repaired

The missing sell orders have now been restored to their rightful owners. The problem was traced to a rogue trader bent on undermining the Heimatar market by hacking into the central bank computer. The perpetrator is currently in a state of flux after being dissolved into Biomass by the Empires.   
  
In other news, the Grid problem at the Yulai>Amarr gate has now been resolved. There is now no security risk involved in travelling through the gate and autopilot should now function as normal.   
  
We thank you all for your patience and support.
