Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/hurid-akan

**Hurid-Akan** was an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) [Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) involved in the [Omicron Incident](6DrNULs5fhn08ajtKLHiqc). He was tricked into believing his rival, [Kirion](7sZCtX9JZqc6dkDvQrehtS), was going to invade disputed systems. Reluctant to go to war with an poorly-equipped army, he was relieved to discover a [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) arms merchant ([the Broker](35XiT6V98vAeV9AdpZyl72) in disguise) visiting his capital. As open war broke out between the two Holders, the [Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) was forced to send a royal arbitrator to calm things down. By that time, both Holders had already spent their fortunes on weapons.
