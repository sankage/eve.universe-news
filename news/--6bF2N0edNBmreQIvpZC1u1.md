Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/ruhste

The **Ruhste** is a tribal [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) dance. It is
a violent art, characterized by constant spins in the air, and has been
described as art imitating violence imitating art. It was previously
banned by the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) during the occupation, as the
Amarr feared it could be used to secretly teach martial arts. The
practice was resumed following the [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N), but it received no official
funding or approval from the government.
