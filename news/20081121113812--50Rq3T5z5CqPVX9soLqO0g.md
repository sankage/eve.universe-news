Kador Prime - Reports have just come in about ongoing heavy fighting in the Kador Prime system, apparently concentrated around the Kador Family Bureau station at the system's first planet. Combat has also been reported at several other points in the system, but these reports remain unconfirmed still.

Several feeds from eyewitnesses at the station appear to show Gallente forces clashing with ships aligned to the Kador Family.  Amarr Navy fleets have been sighted not three systems away, but appear to thus far be making no move to assist the embattled Kador forces in Kador Prime.
