Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/yc

The **YC** calendar is the universal calendar of [New Eden Cluster](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk). It was created under the [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) treaties that govern [Universal Time](2cJeP2eBHll85PfjQlTtHt).  YC stands for "Yoiul Conference", the conference between the five empires of New Eden: ([Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo), [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp), [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy), [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G)) that led to the forming of CONCORD, held on the Jove [cruiser](3wE5sDRggwgYjiExdCRyL0) ''Yoiul''.  

Year YC0 of the YC calendar corresponds to the year of the conference and respective treaties (23236 A.D.) It utilizes a reconstructed calendar used by the [ancient settlers](1XoG8Nce8LC8gU3N24nkA1) of the cluster.
