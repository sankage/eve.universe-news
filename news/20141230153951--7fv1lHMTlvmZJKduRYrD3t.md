**Umokka, The Forge -**  New Eden Radio's New Years' Eve fireworks show will once more be lighting up the night in Umokka on December 31st. As in previous years, the fireworks show will be held outside the Moon 4 Caldari Navy Testing Facilities. New Eden Radio will be providing the music as well as a carrier and other prizes that will be up for grabs.

Last year's event was a hit, with around 250 capsuleers from all walks of life in New Eden strutting their stuff in ships equipped with fireworks, lasers, snowballs or missiles. Last year's raffle prizes included a Thanatos, two PLEX and a Navy Apocalypse, so be on the lookout for surprise prizes.

As usual the pre-show will start at 23:00 UTC on December 31st, and the party will continue until at least 01:00 on January 1st. All capsuleers are invited to attend. Those who would like to take part in the event are encouraged to come equipped with fireworks, lasers, snowballs or missiles to ring in the New Year in style.
