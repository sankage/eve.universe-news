Due to a serious malfunction in the stargates leading into the Amarr system, resulting in widespread loss of camera drones and sensors for pilots entering the system, the Amarr Championship Award ceremony will not be open to guests as intended. The Emperor's family has released a statement expressing their sorrow because of this and promised a full investigation into the reasons for this serious breakdown in traffic into their throne system. The Champions will receive their awards shortly and the ceremony will be live on channel "Championship_Awards". Pilots are once again warned to stay out of Amarr until further notice, as rescue operations are still underway.
