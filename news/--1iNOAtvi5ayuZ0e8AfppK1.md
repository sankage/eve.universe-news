# Translator Module
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/translator-module

**Translator modules** are devices that translate speech from one
language to the next. While generally flawless when used with the
primary languages of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), they can
have trouble with some older tongues.

Technology
----------

The unique nature of the [capsule](capsule-lore) with its
sophisticated neural rigging gives ship captains the option to link
their minds to all kinds of computer systems. One of these is the
translator module, a standard software bundle featured in all capsules
that allows pod pilots to communicate effortlessly with each other in
their own preferred language.

Development
-----------

Early translation protocols were limited to text input and often
produced inaccurate results. Current versions, on the other hand, can
translate voice and text input and are able to handle slang and accents
as well as anticipate mood swings.

With the steady increase in cyber-implants these translators have begun
appearing outside the capsule as well and many predict that within a few
years translators will make the debate over which language should
prevail in inter-racial communication a futile one.

Effects on inter-racial communication
-------------------------------------

As [cyber implants](6gvL4Ytgm3vJN7gvP6akTd) become more common,
use of translator modules outside the capsule has increased, a
development expected to reduce and eventually eliminate the need for
interpreters in inter-racial communications. The question of which
empire language should be officially recognized will eventually also
become moot.
