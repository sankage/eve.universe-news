**Gravboots** resist gravity and allow a person to jump higher and remain in the air longer. While they can slow a person's fall, they do
not allow the user to fly.

Historical Background
---------------------

[Khanid Innovation](2dbfUfaf5t4JfgI1Rtg7jj) was the first to
develop gravboots. Based on technology being applied in space for years,
Khanid Innovation made the critical breakthrough necessary to allow
their use on planets. Though at first it was thought these boots would
have numerous military applications, the technology could not be
improved enough to meet these standards. Khanid Innovation then shelved
the technology until a small [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) toy company
named Slamco purchased the rights to release gravboots as a novelty
item. Gravboots turned out to be a very popular toy, though the fad has
since died down considerably.

Gravboots soon became regulation in many places for construction
workers and others required to work in any gravity environment at any
height of over five meters.

Circus performers, acrobats, and other entertainers traditionally
comprised the second largest market for gravboots, but in recent years,
the technology has seen increasing use in the fashion industry. These
types of gravboots usually supply much less resistance to gravity, but
provide sufficient compensation to the muscles of
[capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) and others who spend large amounts
of time in no/low-g environments.
