# Antique Painblade
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/antique-painblade

The **antique painblade** is the traditional precursor to the modern
day's Painblade. In ancient times, [Jin-Mei](6SFvK45QIlCCCoNODY3gUB)
soldiers riding to the field used to plunge their swords into filth, in
the well-founded expectation that the wounds they inflicted would cause
infection and rot. This nasty tactic was given new life when royal
technicians (in those days referred to as Nuyin, something akin to
"wizards") developed a blade whose surface, when unsheathed, swiftly
attracted and encouraged bacterial growth, giving life to all kinds of
deadly filth.
