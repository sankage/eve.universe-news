Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/warp-tunnel

A **warp tunnel** is the area of depleted vacuum created by a spaceship's [warp drive](7o1BhmhKqoA32WfmkW8Yqt) when it enters warp.
It's possible for another pilot to see a warp tunnel as it forms around another ship activating its warp drive.
