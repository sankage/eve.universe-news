**Hydrotrisulfate** is an acidic compound with many industrial
applications.

Historical Background
---------------------

First discovered by the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) almost a
thousand years ago, Hydrotrisulfate was used to create chemical
reactions mostly in the manufacturing of dyes. Though some discussion
evolved around medical uses for the substance, its corrosivity,
particularly in regards to exposed human organs, soon discounted it for
medical applications.

While still used in the dye manufacturing industry, it has seen
increased use by chemists in various industrial and manufacturing
processes.
