Kor-Azor Prime â€“ *** This is a breaking news report *** The Elder fleets operating in the Kor-Azor Region of the Amarr Empire and Derelik Region of the Ammatar Mandate are retreating towards Minmatar Republic borders. Imperial Navy forces are in pursuit and are engaging the attackers wherever they can be caught. The wrecks of dozens of capital-class Minmatar vessels have been spotted by Scope News camera drones thus far. The general retreat follows the appearance of Jamyl Sarum and the unexplained destruction of the third Elder strike force operating over the planet Mekhios. 

The resurgence of the former heir, long believed dead, is confirmed to be among the pursuing Imperial vessels and appears to have inspired the Amarrian counterattack.
