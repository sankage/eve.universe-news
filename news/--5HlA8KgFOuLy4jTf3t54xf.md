# Khanid II
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/khanid-ii

Garkeh Khanid (born 22972 AD), better known by his regnal name
**Khanid II**, is the current sovereign of the
[Khanid Kingdom](khanid-kingdom) and head of the
[Khanid Family](1dQRsN9IAaCTVkatH4haam). Prior to the ascension of
[Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV) to the [Imperial Throne](Amarr-Emperor)
of the [Amarr Empire](Amarr-Empire), he was one of the
[Amarr Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh), but refused to commit
[Shathol'Syn](Shathol'Syn) upon his defeat and rebelled to
found his eponymous kingdom.

Early Life
----------

Garkeh was born in 22972 AD as the first son of the Khanid Heir. From an
early age, he was groomed to take over for his father. Proving to be a
charismatic child and a natural leader, his father nurtured his ambition
and drive while also ensuring he received the best schooling in
religion, military strategy, and politics. He seemed to excel in all
areas of leadership, earning his position as Heir presumptive.

When his father died in 23033 AD, Garkeh claimed his position as Heir
and was subsequently made the Grand Admiral of the [Amarr Navy](amarr-navy).
One of his first acts was
promoting his brother [Dakos](Dakos-Khanid) to Admiral of the
3rd Fleet, a fleet with much history among the Khanid Family. He made
similar promotions throughout the Navy, carefully placing commanders
loyal to him in positions of importance, while slowly shuffling off
those who might challenge his authority to dangerous or unimportant
posts.

Life as an Heir
---------------

Much of Garkeh's time as an Heir was spent overseeing the expansive
Amarr Navy. In those days, the Empire's main threat came from piracy,
heretics, and disunified Minmatar terrorists. As Grand Admiral, he was a
very hands-on commander-in-chief, often leading the charge against
threatening elements in his flagship. This, coupled with his careful
promotions, won him widespread loyalty within the Navy. Soon, the Khanid
Family dominated the Amarr Navy from the top down, making Garkeh the
most powerful and influential Heir in the Empire.

Garkeh wielded his influence openly and without restraint. He often used
his power to get his way, claiming rich systems, favorable trade
agreements, and placing his underlings in positions of strength. Thanks
to his charisma, he was able to keep his enemies constantly off balance,
playing them against each other while picking up the scraps in the
fallout.

When the emperor died in 23041 AD, Garkeh was widely assumed to be
the one who would win the throne. However, the succession trial did not
go his way. To the surprise of many, Heideran Kador, claimed victory and
ascended to the throne instead.

Schism from the Amarr Empire
----------------------------

Despite imperial law demanding Garkeh forfeit his life in ritual
suicide, the young Heir famously refused to do so. He immediately
challenged the validity of the succession trials and, when his
objections were denied, famously declared, "I will not be ordered by
some whimpering fool to destroy myself when my work is unfinished. You
will not take anything from me, not my kingdom, not my people and least
of all my life." He called on his loyal followers to rally about
him. He confiscated one of the Empire's two [Titans](Titans),
took a third of the Navy which remained loyal to him, and withdrew to
the Khanid region to fortify his holdings.

Soon after, he declared his domains the sovereign Khanid Kingdom, named
himself King Khanid II (posthumously promoting his father to the
position of King Khanid I), and dared the Empire to dispute him. At the
time, Emperor Heideran VII was busy strengthening his own hold on the
Imperial Throne, while the other four royal families were busy inducting
new Heirs and getting their own affairs in order. Coupled with the
defection of a large portion of the Navy, the Empire was in no position
to attempt to put down the rebellion.

In an effort to hold the fracturing Empire together, the Theology
Council gave Khanid II a chance to explain himself. In response, Khanid
II sent the Council an inverted Imperial Seal in Khanid Family colors.
The Theology Council interpreted this as meaning he considered man's law
(ie. his own) to be more important than God's law, and thus a direct
challenge to their own authority. Whatever Khanid's intent, he adopted
the symbol as his royal seal.

Dakos's Rebellion
-----------------

For the first year of Khanid II's reign, the Kingdom was unified behind
him. However, behind the scenes his brother Dakos secretly gathered
support against him. In 23042 AD, Dakos declared himself the true Heir
to the Khanid Family and rose up in rebellion against his brother. He
had gathered the support of a large number of the
[Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) under Khanid's rule.

The war was hard fought in the beginning, with Dakos's fleets making
significant gains against Khanid's forces while suffering heavy losses.
Eventually, the war bogged down into a stalemate. Dakos massed his
forces for a final push into the heart of the Kingdom, but before he
could, he was assassinated by his adopted son Luxian, who had been
turned to Khanid II's side during captivity. With Dakos's death, the
remnants of his forces fell apart.

Dakos's rebellion had two important lasting effects on the Kingdom. The
first, and perhaps most significant, was that the
[Royal Khanid Navy](royal-khanid-navy) was hardened by the crucible of war,
allowing it to stand firm when the Empire finally invaded. Secondly, in
an effort to stave off future coup attempts by his family, Khanid II
demanded all women and children of the lesser branches live in the royal
palace alongside him, ostensibly as guests, to act as hostages and
insurance against future rebellion.

Rule over the Khanid Kingdom
----------------------------

The Khanid Kingdom in many ways resembles the Amarr Empire. The caste
system is intact \- the Holders still reign as the social elite. The
governmental structure and administration are all but identical, the
only difference being the lack of checks-and-balances that many
entrenched institutions and local barons exercise within the Empire.
Khanid II is in name the undisputed leader of his realm, but in practice
a number of magnates and Holders share or dilute this power. Khanid II
has proven to be a somewhat hands-off ruler on the issue of
[slavery](Slavery#Khanid-Kingdom), allowing his Holders to
rule in what manner they see fit. Additionally, as there is no Theology
Council or centralized religious authority in the Kingdom aside from the
King, the Kingdom Holders assume many of the duties undertaken by the
priesthood in the Empire.

He personally can be counted as more lackadaisical and secular than the
typical Amarr. This comes partly from that he redefined the position
between God and man in a new way, and partly because he and the Kingdom
embraces technology, including [cloning](cloning), much more
willingly than the Empire.

His policies can be described as an attempt to modernize the Khanid
economy and society, which many claim to be highly successful. Socially,
the Kingdom is widely considered far more dynamic and robust than the
Empire. He has pushed for open trade with outsiders, particularly with
the [Caldari State](Caldari-State), whom have become close
allies of the Kingdom as a result. Over the centuries, the two have
grown so close that many outsiders describe the Kingdom as a surreal mix
of the Empire and the State.

Relations with the Empire
-------------------------

In the early years, Khanid II held a very hostile view of the Empire,
which reciprocated the feelings. Khanid II openly coveted the Imperial
Throne, but was also cognizant of the shortcomings of his smaller
military. Though the Empire's invasions of the Kingdom were turned back
by his more tactically sound fleet, he realized the advantages of
fighting defensively would prove disastrous if he attempted a direct
invasion of the Empire.

Instead, as the Empire lost interest in reclaiming the Kingdom's
territory, Khanid II was content to allow the two nations to settle into
an uneasy peace. When the disastrous [Amarr-Jove War](Amarr-Jove-War)
and subsequent [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N) occurred in the Empire, Khanid
briefly saw a chance to invade, but for unknown reasons failed to grasp
it. Eventually, Khanid II became a signatory to the
[CONCORD](CONCORD) treaty, which brought the Kingdom into
general alignment with the Empire.

As the influence of the nascent [Minmatar Republic](Minmatar-Republic)
and potential hostile [Gallente Federation](Gallente-Federation) grew, Khanid II found his
interests aligning more and more closely with those of the Empire. The
two settled into a cold, but comfortable peace. As Khanid II began to
relax his grip over the Kingdom, a political movement known as the
[Khanid Unionists](Khanid-Unionists) began to emerge,
advocating a full reconciliation between the two Amarr nations. While
true reconciliation seemed impossible, Khanid II and Heideran VII
famously put aside their old grudges to sign a Treaty of Perpetual
Friendship near the end of Heideran's life; a treaty later reaffirmed by
[Doriam II](Doriam-II).

Partial Reconciliation
----------------------

Following [Jamyl I's](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) ascension to the Imperial
Throne in [YC110](Year-YC110), Khanid II began a series of
negotiations with the [Tash-Murkon Family](tash-murkon-family) to widen his influence in the
Empire. The two entered into several lucrative trade agreements, which
led the Tash-Murkon to rescuing a Khanid transport from piracy.
Subsequently, the king bade his trade ministry assist in the negotiation
of the Caldari-Amarr Economic Stimulus Agreement.

In late December YC110, Khanid II ordered the Royal Navy to begin
assaulting numerous [Blood Raider](Blood-Raider) targets
within their borders. The scope of the attack was larger even than the
Empire's ejection of the Covenant from [the Bleak
Lands](the-Bleak-Lands), leading many to wonder at the
purpose. Though the Kingdom insisted the attacks were simply an
effort to stem the spread of heresy, days after the offensive, the
Empire announced that the Kingdom had captured its traitorous former
[Court Chamberlain](court-chamberlain) [Dochuta Karsoth](Dochuta-Karsoth).
Khanid II quickly turned him over to Imperial authorities.

On May 26th, YC111, the Khanid Royal 1st Fleet, the personal escorts of
King Khanid II, crossed into Imperial space. The fleet was immediately
met by ships from the Amarr Navy, which took up escort positions.
The group traveled to Tash-Murkon Prime, where Khanid II met personally
with Heir [Catiz Tash-Murkon](Catiz-Tash-Murkon). They
revealed that the meeting was planned and that it was the beginning of a
"new era for the Amarr Empire." The two held closed-door meetings
for several days, before the king departed for [Amarr
Prime](Amarr-Prime) where he was met personally by
Empress Jamyl I. The meeting was the first between the two heads of
state and the first time Khanid II had set foot on Amarr Prime since his
rebellion.

After several days of meetings between the empress and king, the five
heirs were called to a full [Privy Council](Privy-Council)
meeting. This meeting also extended over several days, interrupted
only by the sudden departure of [Yonis Ardishapur](Yonis-Ardishapur),
who left his nephew Arim behind to act in his stead.

On June 7th, Jamyl I made a historic announcement, officially granting
the Khanid Kingdom a full seat on the Privy Council. Given partially in
return for the Kingdom's assistance in capturing Dochuta Karsoth, the
Kingdom in turn agreed to acknowledge Jamyl I as the empress of Amarr.
The Kingdom remained independent, but entered into a mutual defense pact
with the Empire.

Current Disposition
-------------------

Despite his advanced age, Khanid II remains in fair health and publicly
appears to be relatively youthful. Though it has never been publicly
acknowledged, rumors claim Khanid II has abandoned the precept of
[Sacred Flesh](Sacred-Flesh) and has undergone therapeutic
[cloning](cloning) to extend his youth. How much of this
rumor is truth and how much can be attributed to the legendary longevity
of the Khanid Heirs is up to debate.

Though he has apparently discarded some of the traditional Imperial
trappings, Khanid II has retained some stereotypically Amarr habits
which have drawn the ire of many outsiders. Of particular note is his
possession of a former Gallente pop star as a personal slave. The
Gallente Federation has, on numerous occasions, attempted to have her
freed to no avail.

Though Khanid II has the right to attend Privy Council meetings in
person, he frequently sends a delegate in his stead. This is not an
uncommon occurrence among the Heirs, but it has still drawn some
criticism, as the seat has only been recently granted. Similarly, the
exact rights granted by the seat remain murky, with observers unsure if
it grants him and his family a claim to the throne in the event of need
for a future succession trials.
