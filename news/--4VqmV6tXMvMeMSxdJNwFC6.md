**Arek** is a [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) black ops soldier. He and his partner [Klar](51tUVCSEn7pPOfWpvM9XE1) participated in an operation to extract a [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) war criminal from his hiding place on a distant world in low sec. He and Klar entered the war criminal's home and discovered the letter left behind detailing the booby traps that had been left for any extraction force that would come for him. He read the letter, which explained the early warning system, underground bunkers, and death trap that would kill the entire town's population should the war criminal's bunker be opened.

Arek was hesitant to do anything that would result in the deaths of innocent people, but faced with the arrival of enemy forces, Arek ordered Klar to go in and kill the war criminal, which he did.
