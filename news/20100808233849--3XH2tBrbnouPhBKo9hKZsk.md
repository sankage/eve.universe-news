 **Jita, The Forge** \- Tarac Nor, [the capsuleer behind the betrayal and disbanding of Ushra'Khan](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=4010) [UNITY] has confirmed rumours by openly joining HYDRA RELOADED [HYDRA].  
  
Tarac has confirmed that he was paid five billion ISK by HYDRA for "station docking and as sort of a gift". This will not come as a shock to the former members of UNITY who had always suspected that ISK was changing hands.  
  
Long-term, Tarac has revealed that he plans to stay at HYDRA for as long as he is "welcome", stating that the capsuleers of HYDRA are "really cool guys to fly with."  
  
Even though he does not have any plans for the immediate future, Tarac did express a wish of being a CEO: "I'll stay in HYDRA and have fun. I dont really have any plans at this point. I may try my hand at running a [combat] corporation of my own."  
  
In closing, Tarac expressed no wish to speak to any of his former alliance members, apparently wanting to put it all behind him: "What's done is done, they have moved on. I've spoken to my friends in private."
