**Annes** is a [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) who recently returned to the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) following the Elder War on the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo).

At one point he visited a bar where he met [Sispur](61wTpOF3caRsctnEDDzVRa) and [Triat](331ej8qexWhiEiFsLNZJuF). Annes examined his position as a member of the "lost tribe" of Minmatar and how his tribe's miraculous survival and return to the Republic had impacted him personally. He noted that prior to their rescue, they had no identity and now they had one thrust upon them suddenly. He related a story where a woman had sex with him simply because he was a Starkmanir and noted that the populace at large viewed him as a sign of hope. He eventually decided that the Starkmanir were a part of the Republic that were essential and that there was no other place for him beside the Republic.
