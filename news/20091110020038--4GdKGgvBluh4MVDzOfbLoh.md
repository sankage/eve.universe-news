 **Geminate, U-L4KS** : In what has been reported as "an attempt to gain a foothold in the Geminate region", SOLAR FLEET [SOLAR] forces engaged elements of the Wildly Inappropriate. [WI.] alliance, losing fourteen of their carriers in the process.  
  
Tomcat, of Lone Star Joint Venture [LSJV], alliance leader for [WI.] reports that during an operation to take down several SOLAR FLEET towers "[SOLAR] shows up in the system U-L4KS, with their fleet of forty to fifty, mostly battleships, and begins to hit a jump bridge tower in that system." Tomcat goes on to set the stage by stating "we jump in, bubbles go up and the fight begins; both sides were heavy RR-based (remote repairing) so a nice slugfest begins."  
  
What happens next is a gradual escalation of "capital ship support drops", first by [WI.], followed by [SOLAR]. The exact number of carriers on the field is not known, but it is estimated at over thirty combined total.  
  
When the fight ended, Solar Fleet suffered a loss of fourteen carriers, while Wildly Inappropriate. lost none. According to DENWIR, member of The First Foundation [TFFN], fleet Commander for [SOLAR] two mistakes contributed to this loss: allowing the battle to take place in range of the [WI.] tower which "interrupted the spider tank on the carriers with it's constant jamming" and "being surprised by the [WI.] reinforcements, which made the numbers 64 vs. 191."  
  
While Tomcat acknowledges that this battle did not change the balance of power between the two opposing alliances, he feels that "this was definitely a morale boost for [WI.]; having such a decisive victory... as far as overall status of geminate, it still fully remains under WI control."
