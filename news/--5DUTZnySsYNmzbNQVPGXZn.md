# Intaki
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/intaki

The **Intaki** are a major bloodline within the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and one
of its four founding members along with the Gallente, the
[Mannar](4BaMCkOwYaPpd4ZMtEfEY) and the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy). Their
homeworld is the fifth planet of the [Intaki solar system](17xNygfKnuI4d0t0JHAU0Z),
in the Viriette constellation of
the Placid region.

Joining the Federation immediately after its founding, the Intaki remain
one of the largest ethnicities of the nation. Exceedingly gifted
communicators, the Intaki are today very prominent among the Federal
bureaucracy. Though Gallente culture has permeated their society to some
extent, they still cling to their cultural identities and beliefs, most
notably their unusual theories regarding the human life cycle\-in
particular, death and rebirth. These theories give them a unique outlook
on life and the living, and many attribute the Intaki's stoic nature to
this philosophy.

Because of political turmoil during the first
[Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV), a number of Intaki were forced
out of the Federation, eventually forming what is now the
[Intaki Syndicate](4DOTqrhXfEcWH1ygU05Vby).

Racial Traits
-------------

The Intaki male is methodical and reserved, never outspoken or
confrontational. He generally enjoys quiet reflection, and Intaki homes
are traditionally places of peace and tranquility. The typical Intaki
has absolute control over his emotions and is able to remain calm even
under the most trying circumstances.

Like their male counterparts, Intaki females are quiet and
contemplative, moving through the world seemingly without making a
ripple. Yet their contemplative manner often embraces great beauty
through both physical and literary arts. A great number of the
universe's most notable contemporary artists are of Intaki heritage, and
among them a disproportionately large number are female.

Ancestry
--------

### Artist ancestry

It is widely believed that the introvert Intaki create the most stunning
and thought-provoking art around. They've revolutionized many art-forms
and created new, such as metapaints and touch sculpture. Intaki artists
seem to have a unique ability to create and convey unparalleled beauty
that is universal for all human races.

### Diplomats ancestry

Since their inauguration into the Federation the Intaki have slowly
established a reputation as superb diplomats, negotiators, and
bureaucrats. In the tense and often violent world of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk)
these qualities can be of vital
importance.

### Reborn ancestry

Although persons in risky positions (such as starship captains) use
clones, the general Intaki public refrains from using them. Instead they
have a unique method for transferring the personality of a dying person
into a newborn baby. Steeped in tradition and perfected with technology,
the Reborn process is the ideal Intaki vision of 'afterlife'.

Homeworld
---------

Intaki V, known to as "Intaki Prime" to its inhabitants, is a tropical planet and a place of great natural beauty.
In a speech, Vremaja Idama described it:

"Intaki Prime is a jewel among planets. It is tropical and filled with diverse lifeforms. We have lived and grown on this planet for time beyond measure. I was born in the town of Asaya, sitting at the base of the Akat mountain range. These mountains mark the southern end of the habitable region of the north pole. My town was hidden from the harsh sunlight in the deep valleys that intersect the mountain range. Intaki Prime is a very hot world, and both polar regions were once thick with tropical forests. The equatorial oceans are exceedingly hot, and few living things survive around the equator. The rich and varied life of Intaki Prime has been confined to the polar regions, and in constant struggle for land, food, and shelter from the environment."

The administrative capital of Intaki V is the city of Navyii Akat, a former mining town in the foothills of the Akat Mountains that expanded rapidly when the Intaki Assembly chose it as its meeting place due to its relatively central location. 

The traditional and cultural capital of Intaki Prime is Lenoika, which remains the largest population center of the planet. The ancient city sprawls across a coastal river delta fed by a system of tributaries that ultimately rise from the Akat range far to the south-east. 

In contrast to the beauty of the planet's surface, the Intaki solar
system has a 0.1 security status rating from
[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt). Similarly low security status exists
throughout most of the Placid region, with the elevated crime rates that
come with it. This has been a source of political contention, especially
among [capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ).

History and Politics
--------------------

The first contact between the Gallente and the Intaki was made in 22794
AD, 327 years before the founding of the Federation. At the time, the
Intaki were technologically pre-industrial but socially and culturally
advanced. Within a century, they caught up with the Gallente, mastering
space travel to settle other nearby regions and holding positions in the
Gallente government.

When the Intaki were negotiating for Federation membership, one of the
stipulations of their joining was for a minimal
[Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) presence in the system. "The original
Intaki representatives asked for minimal protection at the founding of
the Federation," according to Vremaja Idama. "We have always valued our
independence and self-reliance." In the modern era, however, he says,
"We have been left to suffer", referring to the lackluster response to
the Reschard V disaster and the rampant space piracy that didn't exist
when the original deal was made.

Intaki citizens in the Federation comprise the largest portion of the
"Doves" voting block. Doves object to military action in all but the
most clearly defensive cases, though do not endorse total pacifism and
similarly extremist views.

### The Gallente-Caldari War

During the breakout of the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV), many Intaki sympathized
with the Caldari, both openly and not. This was a potentially dangerous
position to have with the ultra-nationalist politicians that had taken
over the Federation government at the time.

Of the active dissenters, those that were deemed the biggest threat to
the Federation were arrested and exiled, forbidden to colonize any
planets or moons. A group of these exiles built stations in lawless
space and formed The Intaki Syndicate in the region that now bears the
same name. Dorn en Diabel, governor of the station in Poitot, became the
de facto leader and established the Syndicate as a free haven from the
empires as well as a hub of black market trade. After his death in a
freak accident, governorship of the station bounced between his sons
until his daughter, Silphy en Diabel, took over. Because of her ties
with V. Salvador Sarpati, the Syndicate is now known to have connections
with the [Serpentis](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs).

A group of more militant exiles went to the Caldari and joined the
[Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN). They were put under the command
of the Caldari commander Muryia Mordu and earned a reputation as an
elite fighting unit. After the war they were allowed to settle in Waschi
City on the planet of Kamokor IV. They remained there until xenophobic
sentiment among the Caldari lead to violence and ultimately drove them
out. They called on Mordu for assistance and went on to form the
mercenary corporation [Mordu's Legion](5csCeDqUe1exvVyfPdL75Q). 

Vremaja Idama, who had been Reborn many times dating back before contact
between the Gallente and Intaki and gave history lectures at the
[University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM), described the
situation of Intaki who remained with the Federation at the time:

"We were afraid of those "in power". (...) [Violence was] never threatened openly. But when our fellow Federation citizens were bombarded, it was not a huge leap of reasoning to believe that any others expressing rebellious attitudes would be similarly dealt with. Whether it was true or not, I don't know. But we were afraid, and so many remained quiet and sought other ways to continue. Some left. Others became politicians."

### YC 105 - YC 109

#### Reschard V

On February 8, YC 108, a planet-wide explosion struck the planet of
Reschard V, destroying the agricultural, primarily Intaki colony and
rendering the planet largely uninhabitable. The blast was eventually
determined by [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) and Mordu's Legion
investigators to have been caused by the deployment of a Judgement
doomsday device from an Avatar-class Titan, which escaped through a
cynosaural field accompanied by the activation of several other cynos to
cover its tracks. It took rescue convoys from the [Sisters of EVE](77ihwsVRHRojCaPC5XZn2g) over seven months to reach the planet
surface safely, further complicated by pirate attacks on the convoys.
CONCORD has never released details on the perpetrator.

#### Gallente Elections

Durring the presidential election of YC 108, Intaki voters played a
significant role in the re-election of [Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt). The controversial proposals of
[Mentas Blaque](1bZzUGejHEhyHp6LVUtjBT) to segregate immigrant
populations into designated districts and his ultranationalist leanings
brought voters to the polls in droves.

### The Empyrean Age - YC 110 to present

In the aftermath of the Caldari attack on Luminaire, most Intaki in the
Federation were as appalled as the rest of their fellow citizens at the
events. Those that associate with the Doves were equally appalled at
calls for unrestrained retaliation and hope that Luminaire can be
recovered as peacefully as possible. A fringe element still sympathize
with the Caldari cause but so far has not expressed itself in unrest on
the scale of what occurred during the first war a century ago.

Because of the CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act, most of Placid,
including the Intaki system, is part of the active war zone in the
current war between the Gallente Federation and the Caldari State.
Placid shares a border with the Caldari State at [Black Rise](black-rise).

Having watched in horror the bloodshed of the two temporary war zones,
the station administrators of the Syndicate are having to ask themselves
some very difficult questions. While nominally a wholly independent and
non-aligned body, the Syndicate has nevertheless always retained strong
ties to the Federation. Currently, their residents are feeling immensely
sympathetic to the plight of their Federal brothers\-particularly fellow
Intaki\-even to the point of suggesting a more moderate stance toward
them. The more far-sighted officials, however, have a feeling that
relations will get a lot worse before they get better.

In the third month of YC 111, Federation forces in the Intaki system
fell to the [State Protectorate](2VlyV0CDyxFv0Qg3N3dW8k), ceding
occupancy to the Caldari state. Unrest and violence broke out in
places on the Intaki homeworld, divided between pro-Federation,
pro-State and Intaki secessionist factions. Active protests mostly
abated over the following weeks, but the general unrest persisted amid
worry over the intentions of the Caldari (who did not take control on
the ground at the time) and shortages of high-tech and heavy industry
goods. Panic resumed mid-August upon the announcement that the 
Caldari Providence Directorate would be
auctioning off development rights to the occupied systems, prompting the
planetary government to instate a curfew. Fear and speculation led
to a tense standoff in one farming community between police and
armed would-be resistance forces, although the standoff ended
peacefully. The system was bid on and the auction won by [Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI). Unknown to the general
public, Ishukone was involved in a deal with an anonymous Gallente or
Intaki capsuleer to acquire the system as a form of protective
custody. As with all other Caldari-occupied systems, Intaki was
barred from voting in the Gallente presidential elections of November YC
111 triggered by the resignation of Souro Foiritan, a fact which may
have hurt the chances of candidate Celes Aguard against the
eventual winner, [Jacus Roden](1ijjvREo0tNCQD1EKlUa5z).

Culture
-------

### Ida - The Intaki Faith

In a speech given upon his return to Intaki from Bourynes, Vremaja Idama
spoke of the Intaki Way:

"We are considered by outsiders to be a quiet, reserved and thoughtful people. The unwritten laws, or customs, of the Intaki give rise to these impressions. We tend to think before we speak, preferring to give a concise statement rather than half formed thoughts. When someone is involved in a task we prefer to let them acknowledge our presence rather than interrupting. We also tend to look at problems in a more holistic way, considering all things connected.
Much of this is crystallized in our philosophy, or as others call it "the Intaki Faith". We simply call it Ida—the literal translation is "to consider", and is a good description of the Intaki. Some try to belittle us by calling it "the path of least resistance", although that is a good description!

We who follow the Way aim to live a life of moderation, not succumbing to the extremes of self-indulgence or self-denial. Ida is a way of living, we do not have any beliefs in a heaven or hell, and do not take any writing or saying as "truth". Ida is a path, but Intaki are expected to walk it themselves.

One core tenet is that all things are in a cycle. Death leads to rebirth. A solution only leads to more problems. We know that the "soul" or "spirit" is eternal and will be reborn many times to learn new lessons, and once it fully understands the cycle it may finally move on. The Reborn are an important part of this. These were people who had reached a level of understanding that they may choose to be liberated, but choose to remain and teach others. In earlier times there were many tests and rituals to ensure that a soul had indeed been reborn, and through mental discipline and training these Reborn were able to continue their life work over many lifetimes. These rare people were given the title of Idama.

In modern times, with the assistance of technology, the rebirth process has been made more certain. In fact many of the techniques and experiences of the Reborn have assisted the development and perfection of psyche restoration and cloning. But even today the status of Idama is still reserved for those who have been reborn without assistance."

Notable Intaki
--------------

The former President of the Gallente Federation, Souro Foiritan is of
Intaki ancestry. It was a sudden surge in voting from Intaki and Mannar
citizens that secured his victory over Mentas Blaque, whose
nationalistic campaign platform included a proposal to segregate
communities of non-Gallente immigrants.

A couple of Idama have made headlines among the capsuleer community in
past years:

-   Vremaja Idama is an outspoken advocate of Intaki culture and the
    improvement of security for the Placid region.
-   Sundari Idama was involved in a drug-trafficking scheme which
    resulted in a major incident (commonly known as the RISE Incident),
    in which a Serpentis carrier full of RISE was intercepted and
    captured by a fleet of capsuleer pilots under the temporary command
    of Vorada Kuvakei of the Illoren and then impounded by Inspector
    Xavier of [Federation Customs](2LZwH7MsRSRhlMHNegrgGx).

Silphy en Diabel is the de facto leader of the Intaki Syndicate after
taking over from her late father and seizing power from her less
competent brothers.
