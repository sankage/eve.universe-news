# Microblade Scythe
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/microblade-scythe

**Microblade scythes** are crude tools made of wood, leaves, and stone,
still used in many parts of the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) to harvest wheat.

Historical Background
---------------------

Microblade technology is a more recent development of a stone-age
innovation, one that has fallen out of use almost everywhere except on
the wheat plantations of the Amarr Empire. Discovered independently by a
variety of people, its use died out almost everywhere. Only the
[Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) continued to use this technology up
to modern times, specifically to form clearings in the thick jungles of
[Starkman Prime](hhT3DOiMGuhLQl0vmNbuY). Its use was readapted for
[wheat](5nxVzXKqvyLGbxwGIW1MVy) harvesting by the Amarr, and proved more
economical than previous tools, as they were cheap and easy to make. It
has been the preferred tool for harvesting wheat throughout the Empire
ever since.

Appearance
----------

Microblade scythes have a slightly down-curved blade, approximately 24
centimeters long, and six centimeters wide, usually fashioned from
silica-rich stone. The handles are typically wood, though some
ornamental scythes have handles made from bone. Usually about a meter in
length, these handles are often wrapped with leaves near the top and
bottom for a more comfortable grip.
