# Year YC110
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/year-yc110

The turn of the year **YC110** saw events carry on much as they had the
previous year, with little to suggest the tumultuous changes that would
begin to take place in only a few months' time. Looking at the early
months of the year, we might discern faint traces of what was to come,
but only with the gift of hindsight could they be marshaled into a
pattern leading to a day that will forever be remembered in the history
of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).


January
-------

January began with some controversy as the
[Secure Commerce Commission](7v1HmgfP9wx45IXYZCbWbK)
(SCC), accompanied by [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) police, raided the
headquarters of the [Caldari State's](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) [Chief Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr) (CEP) in search of
records that might show the involvement of the [Angel Cartel](3p6aB4GMbVdMUEVYOb3kF0) in Caldari corporate affairs. The
submission of the CEP to this search, subpoena or no, marked perhaps the
lowest point yet in the independence of the State, a guiding principle
since its foundation, and arguably, given events later in the year, the
zenith of CONCORD's power with respect to the four great empires.

The Independent Gaming Commission formally announced the 5th Alliance
Tournament and the rules governing the always keenly anticipated clash
of independent [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) alliances. Interest
among planetside broadcast networks was said to be at the highest yet
for an event of this type.

The month closed with the Amarr [7th Fleet](7xcqb3UtNf8RQP1f4jJ6cp) under
the command of Admiral [Vanazir Saracen](vanazir-daracen) -
the fleet styling itself 'The Saracens' in his honor - scoring in the
Bleak Lands what may have looked like a crippling blow against the
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) rebels known as the
"[Defiants](6aq75j8f7bMZckaqXWXSC6)," destroying two capital ships and a
dozen support vessels. Admiral Saracen, having fought the Defiants for
many months, may perhaps have realized privately that the rebel group
was down but not yet out.

February
--------

February saw the official launch of a new advanced frigate class, the
electronic attack ships. [Lai Dai Corporation](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT) in particular trumpeted the
virtues of its Kitsune-class version and seemed to eclipse other
manufacturers in promoting its electronic countermeasure platform.

Scientists concentrated on
the unusual 'stellar object' that had been looming bright in the star
field across the New Eden cluster, with the [University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM) organizing a conference to
discuss it. The [Blood Raiders](7obiU8rOyJkPZ3S0Faxc5W) chose to
express their views on the object by disrupting an Amarr
[Holder's](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) 85th anniversary celebrations in order to
broadcast claims that it heralded their triumph over the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo).

Controversy erupted in full force as the month drew to a close with the
leak of a confidential report on CONCORD operation in the so-called
"Drone Regions" (also known as the "New Regions") in the "northeast"
quadrant of the New Eden cluster. The activities of the Code Aria
Inquiry into rogue drone infestations, and the implications of the
leaked dossier, caused outrage across the major empires, with the
Caldari State and Amarr Empire being most vehement in their condemnation
of CONCORD's Inner Circle.

Even the start of the 5th Alliance Tournament at the very end of the
month was not free of controversy. The [Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO)
denounced the organizers for excluding them from entering a team, and it
was revealed that Caldari mega-corporations had sent recruiters from
their corporate security forces to watch the event.

March
-----

March kicked off with the all the drama and destruction of the 5th
Alliance Tournament. With various factions sponsoring teams, the
interest among planetside populations was at an all-time high. [Maleatu Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV), Speaker of the [Republic Parliament](2EcbNQu5ua4Jjt3TTM0CvW), even went so far as to endorse the
Ushra'Khan team, causing much comment outside the Republic. One Amarr
Holder incurred much disapproval by betting heavily on the anarchist
Star Fraction alliance, avowed enemies of the Amarr Empire. The
tournament continued through the first week to crescendo toward the
thrilling final between Triumvirate and Ev0ke. A hard-fought battle saw
Ev0ke triumph and win the championship and glory for their
[Serpentis Corporation](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs) sponsors, who wasted no
time in boasting of the win.

Interest in the
so-called 'Bright Star' continued, with Sanyen Grulliver, a
[Vherokior Tribe](6VDPzsKX9TVbVtXEwjj0RB) shaman, mounting an expedition
to investigate the anomaly, believing it to be a gateway to a spirit
land inhabited by the ancestors of Minmatar. Much mocked, the expedition
faltered when the anomaly abruptly disappeared around the middle of the
month. Interest in the Bright Star diminished after the incident.

Warfare in the Bleak Lands continued in the meantime, with the Defiants
striking back in resounding fashion after their losses in January, with
eight key 7th Fleet installations destroyed in one day of co-ordinated
assaults. The Amarr reaction to this was largely confined to looking for
and finding a traitor in their own ranks, with the Holder Hejaaz Momir
executed for treason after being found guilty by a military tribunal
appointed by Admiral Saracen. Somewhat controversially, in an act of
literal nepotism, this was followed up with the appointment of Jalir
Saracen, nephew of the Admiral, as the provisional Holder of House Momia
assets.

Amarr troubles continued to the end of month with three prominent
[Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) Justices [Falek Grange](5lwwSw7gaS6ET08mIIEj7a), Aulus Gord and Victor Eliade going
missing along with other council members and many associates.
Conflicting reports surrounded the mysterious disappearances from the
start, with rumours of a massive military build-up in the Sahkt border
system and even sightings of Blood Raiders confusing the picture. The
status of the missing Justices as capsuleers and members of the
'Reformist' tendency within Amarr politics only fueled conspiracy
theories, as did connections to the court of [House Family](4EZ4a3Mw8QXHmisAA4Ff6L).

April
-----

April began with a shocking
address to the Amarr Empire by [Court Chamberlain](4cstqCKrXLAu5XDiqztSe6) [Dochuta Karsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL) - de facto ruler of the imperium
in the absence of an emperor - in which he revealed that the missing
Theology Council Justices had been members of a conspiracy to
assassinate him and take over the Theology Council. Karsoth went on to
announce the capture of the missing justices and their execution as
traitors to the Empire. The [Royal Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) were
notably silent about the entire affair, seeming content to leave matters
to the Court Chamberlain. This turn of events was seen to substantially
enhance Karsoth's power, together with his secure grasp on the loyalty
of [Ministry of Internal Order](5P4c9Lcr1rAUNd2Lb8gb3t)
paladins and the denunciation of the justices as Reformists who sought
to overthrow the traditions and religion of the Amarr Empire.

While
the Theology Council Justices dominated in the first few days of the
month, the major theme of April was increasing instability in the
Caldari State, with shocks experienced on the Kimotoro Stock Exchange
after major mega-corporations such as
[Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK), Lai Dai and
[Wiyrkomi](66psXtrftjRzA7MyKHtb7K) issued profit warnings on
only the second of the month. Together with signs of the economy running
down, protests over working conditions flared up. On Yoma III, work at
the Zumol Chemical plant came to a halt amid violent clashes between
workers and corporate security forces. These came to an end with Zumol
Chemical laying off the entire workforce and shipping in 'strike
breakers.'

Further unrest arose at reports of Kaalakiota's security division, [Home Guard](6ajQ0UPFl2qdootvjTwjG), treating prisoners and even innocent
civilians badly, an embarrassment for Kaalakiota as it opened a new Home
Guard training center. Economic turbulence continued as the CEP debated
higher tariffs on imported goods and it was revealed that both the Lai
Dai and [CBD](7o6AuVZhnq4lIzIMdYdMft) Corporations were considering
investing in foreign markets to hedge against the faltering Caldari
economy.

No improvement in the fortunes of the Caldari State was seen as the bad
news piled up. A planetary agricultural blight took place on Tennen VI,
mass deaths occurred in a Wiyrkomi drugs trial and a massive industrial
accident befell a [Sukuuvestaa](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB)
plant, killing 57 and injuring over 1,200. Indications of a booming
[Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) economy, even to the point of labor
shortages and the need for Minmatar immigrants to fill positions, were
surely a bitter twist if not directly related.

May
---

May was to give its name to a
revolution. While the appointment of a [Brutor](5xBrtZyeYfTxWkZTO1o5zg)
officer, Admiral Ferius Ljarl, as [Republic Fleet](2c4ZwKPnuW6mYkLJ2dGh94) Chief of Naval Operations on the first
day of the month was notable enough in indicating increasing power for
the charismatic Maleatu Shakor, the May Revolution was to take place in
the ailing Caldari State. Although it seemed at first that the trend of
problems in the Caldari State was simply continuing where it left off in
April, what started as a mere worker's revolt at an industrial plant on
Piak III was to become the seed of sweeping change throughout the
Caldari State.

### Rise of [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG)

The [Caldari Constructions](7EMQvTSGfNzShTzezxnMao) Armor Forge on Piak III
was not unique in experiencing a worker's protest on the second day of
May. Facilities in the Aikantoh and Lituria systems were also the scene
of revolts and a general shut-down as workers employed by Caldari
Constructions coordinated a protest against working conditions and the
general lot of the Caldari wage-worker. The unique aspect of the revolt
on Piak III was that it was led by a man the entire cluster would come
to know: Tibus Heth.

The revolt on Piak III also paralyzed and threatened one of the most
important assets of Caldari Constructions, the Armor Forge being a key
facility producing essential components for starship construction.
Perhaps this was why Constructions chose to call in Home Guard, the
security arm of the Kaalakiota mega-corporation, who promptly deployed
dropships full of mechanized infantry to the site. Caldari Constructions
themselves claimed that Heth was holding hostages and threatening to
kill everyone in the Armor Forge, claims that later were shown to be
exaggerated at best. Whatever the rights and wrongs, the dropships fell
and the worker's revolt on Piak III became something altogether more
complicated.

As news of
the revolt and deployment of Home Guard dropships was reported, the
Caldari stock markets reacted by plunging the price of Caldari
Constructions downward. Months of financial shocks had enervated the
Caldari share-traders and the fall of Caldari Constructions stocks was
steep, and slated to become steeper when the Home Guard were deployed
rather than being arrested. The use of mega-corporation security forces
to restore confidence on the markets seemed to have come to an end.
Falls across the Caldari stock markets followed in the wake of the
plummeting Constructions stock. In the narrow sphere of share movements,
the day had already acquired historic aspects.

Events took a grim turn as Home Guard troops opened fire on protesting
workers when Caldari Constructions CEO Torkebaira Shutsu began
negotiations with revolt leader Tibus Heth. If it was an attempt to cut
off the head of the worker's movement by assassinating Heth, it was
spectacularly bungled. With at least one sniper apparently targeting
Heth, a young man who apparently was leading the way to the negotiations
was shot in Heth's stead, prompting further rioting from the workers and
a fierce struggle at the gates. Tibus Heth was recorded by numerous
cameras carrying the body of his comrade to safety, images that were
flashed around the State and New Eden within moments.

Even as Torkebaira Shutsu retreated from the fiasco on Piak III in his
personal dropship, something remarkable was happening on the Caldari
stock markets: Caldari Constructions stock was soaring. A mystery buyer
had started to buy the depressed stocks in increasingly large tranches
even as they had reached rock-bottom and deadly violence erupted at the
Armor Forge. While a stand-off developed at the Armor Forge, with Home
Guard troops unwilling to press forward and create what would
undoubtedly be one of the bloodiest massacres in the history of
industrial unrest in the State, Caldari Constructions stocks were
snapped up. Even as the Kaalakiota Corporation denied giving Home Guard
the authority to open fire, someone acquired a controlling interest in
the corporation at the center of the unrest.

Astoundingly, it transpired that
the someone in question was Tibus Heth. How this happened remains a
mystery and theories abound as to secret backers and puppet masters
behind Tibus Heth. Yet the facts undeniable are that Tibus Heth,
industrial [MTAC](6tgB9Z8SmRZ7VUX3qScODq) operator at the Caldari Constructions
Armor Forge on Piak III, became majority owner of the very corporation
he worked for shortly after noon on the Second of April YC110. Setting
the seal on the new order at Caldari Constructions, the disgraced
Torkebaira Shutsu ceded his personal stocks to Heth before taking his
own life.

As news of the revolutionary events on Piak III spread through the
Caldari State, worker revolts broke out in the territories of all the
mega-corporations with a notable exception being the [Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) holdings, where little
civil disorder was experienced. Mindful of the outrage and escalation
caused by the manner in which Home Guard handled the Piak III situation,
the mega-corporations adopted a less confrontational stance toward such
revolts. Even so, arrests reached into the hundreds as disaffected
workers and youths targeted corporate assets and symbols of the wealth
and authority of the mega-corporations.

The rioting and disruption across the State reached levels that might
have caused the mega-corporations to use deadly force had it not been
for the final remarkable event of that day in May. Having been formally
invested as the CEO of Caldari Constructions, Tibus Heth secured access
to the primary news hub of the Caldari State and broadcast an
unauthorized address to the entire State. In his remarks, Heth railed
against the corruption of the State by the mega-corporations, blamed
Gallente influence for distorting the values of the State's leaders and
pledged to restore Caldari to dignity and power.

Perhaps stunned by the sight of one of their own leading a major
corporation, rioting workers began to return to their homes. The
megacorporations, if anything even more stunned, remained silent. The
first day of the May Revolution was over.

### Ambassador Keitan Yun

As New Eden absorbed the events in the Caldari State, one man's career
began an arc that would lead him to be reviled by some and cheered as a
hero by many others. It started as a fairly mundane matter of the
appointment of Keitan Yun as Minmatar Republic Ambassador to the CONCORD
Assembly. An academic and quiet servant of the Republic held in some
regard by [Prime Minister](11bdx7zZVOpLMWvWjjUg7c) [Karin Midular](3KxlNVAeglPj5ZH0sf3U2j), Yun seemed a choice entirely in
keeping with the thoughtful, technocrat-heavy mode of government Midular
had always stood for.

Many were surprised therefore, not least among them Karin Midular, when
Yun used his inaugural speech to the Assembly to condemn CONCORD for
acquiescence in the slaving practices of the Amarr Empire and its
"hypocrisy" in allowing the Amarr to send representatives to CONCORD at
all. Ejected from the Assembly for refusing to recant, Yun seemed a
broken man. Shunned by his Prime Minister, he disappeared from public
view. His reappearance was to be quite a different matter.

### The Malkalen Incident

In the meantime, simmering resentment over the anti-Gallente sentiments
expressed by Tibus Heth broke out into ethnic violence on Caldari Prime- the ancestral home planet of the Caldari abandoned when the Caldari
seceded from the Gallente Federation- as Gallente gangs vandalized
Caldari heritage sites and attacked Caldari living on the planet. The
violence escalated over the next few days as Gallentes and Caldari
repeatedly clashed over heritage sites and in settlements with high
Caldari populations. The cities of Tovil and Arcurio, in particular, saw
heavy rioting and multiple deaths.

The situation spread from Caldari Prime to the Caldari State after
Federation security forces used deadly force to quell Caldari rioters.
Gallente expatriates in the State came under increasing attack in
retaliation for the violence and rising death toll on [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i). By the 12th of May, many Caldari and
Gallente were so repulsed by the rioting and killing that they held
anti-violence demonstrations. The most poignant of these was the vigil
held at the Landfall Shrine on Caldari Prime, one of the most sacred of
Caldari sites, but spontaneous demonstrations were held across the
Gallente Federation.

Capturing the mood
perfectly, [Otro Gariushi](5QydCJCoYvbvbWvFlAlbHg), the popular CEO of
Ishukone Corporation, pleaded for calm and denounced the anti-Gallente
rhetoric of Tibus Heth in a State-wide broadcast. Caldari stock markets
reacted favourably to Gariushi's sentiments and approval was seen in the
Gallente Federation and even in the Caldari-allied [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj). The impact of Gariushi's speech,
and the grassroots anti-violence movement, was to stymie the violence
before it escalated beyond control.

Within two days, a further remarkable development emerged as Otro
Gariushi and [Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt), Gallente
Federation [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E), agreed to hold an Economic
Summit at Ishukone Headquarters in Malkalen. Appearing somewhat
wrongfooted, Tibus Heth welcomed the news of the Malkalen Summit just as
citizens and markets across New Eden breathed a sigh of relief.

Moving quickly, the Federation sent its Economic Minister, Wadis Chene,
at the head of a delegation transported aboard the mighty FNS Wandering
Saint, a Nyx-class supercarrier piloted by the venerable Admiral
[Alexander Noir](7yGm9JcjjD577R4fjG6D4t) - veteran of
the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV) and
respected on all sides as a man of peace who knew what it was to fight.
As the great vessel, dwarfing its escorts, arrived in Malkalen and
approached a parking orbit with the Ishukone Headquarters station, it
seemed to carry the hopes of both the Caldari State and the Gallente
Federation with it. History will surely view that as the cruellest of
ironies.

We now know that as Otro
Gariushi welcomed Wadis Chene at the formal opening of the Economic
Summit, Admiral Alexander Noir was preparing to initiate a sequence of
events that would leave hundreds of thousands dead. The first sign of
trouble came as the FNS Wandering Saint seemed to, indeed, wander out of
its parking orbit and turn toward the station itself. Alarm grew as the
mighty supercarrier began to accelerate toward the station and all
attempts to contact Noir were ignored.

As the point of no return was reached, those that watched expected a
tragic accident, the destruction of the supercarrier certainly, some
damage to the station perhaps. It is doubtful they expected the
station's shields to fail - a mystery that remains unsolved but is
attributed by many to sabotage by Noir sympathizers - and the ship to
plow into the station like a knife thrust into a living body.

The destruction that followed was on a scale like nothing in recent
memory. No station of this size and density of population had ever
suffered such a catastrophic blow. The situation was so extraordinary
and the nature of the event so crippling that there was a considerable
delay in assessing what had happened. Communications networks came under
severe overload almost as the first brief outlines of events hit the
Caldari State. When realization dawned that a Federation Nyx had rammed
into and partially destroyed a State mega-corporation's headquarters, it
was stunning in its effect. Yet the State rallied and a massive relief
effort swung into action as corporations and independent capsuleers
alike rushed to offer assistance. Reeling and decapitated, the Ishukone
Corporation announced an emergency disaster relief program and the
Servant [Sisters of EVE](2eTQAT2DL0C7TWVtkOr8pN) responded in their
efficient and practiced fashion. By the next day, Ishukone was able to
confirm the deaths of Otro Gariushi and the entire Gallente delegation.
The estimated death toll stood at 421,000 with as many persons remaining
unaccounted. In its scale the disaster was immediately seen as a matter
for the whole Caldari State and in its nature an attack on the entire
State.

Quick to recognize this, the Amarr Empire's [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) declared an official day of
mourning for the Malkalen victims. The Minmatar Republic seemed to await
the position of its ally the Federation, but this was days in coming.
Eventually, four days after the event, President Souro Foiritan of the
Gallente Federation confirmed in all particulars the Ishukone
Corporation's account of the Malkalen Disaster, condemning it as the act
of a single man, Noir, and denying any complicity on the part of the
Federation. Incredible as this may have seemed to some, the Caldari
State took this in grief-stricken silence with little if anything in the
way of anti-Gallente protests or violence breaking out.

While the citizens of the State mourned the victims of Malkalen, Tibus
Heth was not idle. The May Revolution was to enter its next stage with
the foundation of the Caldari Providence
Directorate. This began with
the surprise announcement by [Ytiri](5Ct6qvG5ryJZOQxfA2zbIS) Warehouse CEO
Tantima Iwisoda that he was stepping down and handing full control of
his corporation to Heth's Caldari Constructions. In addressing the new
partnership, Heth announced the formation of the Caldari Providence
Directorate as the controlling organization within the new corporate
structure. The members of this unusual corporate entity soon became
known as the "Provists."

The ability of Tibus Heth and the Provists to acquire another
corporation may have startled some, but Ytiri was a relatively minor
corporation. More than startling - in fact, simply amazing - was the
takeover of Kaalakiota Corporation, the biggest mega-corporation of them
all, by Heth and the Caldari Providence Directorate a mere two days
after the Ytiri acquisition. Apparently effected by virtue of former KK
CEO Haatakan Oiritsuu stepping down in Heth's favor, the Kaalakiota
takeover transformed Heth from a demagogue with the power of a corporate
CEO into arguably the most powerful man in the State.

Concerted opposition by the other mega-corporations could have stopped
Tibus Heth in principle, but it was soon established that the others
were of no mind to act. Addressing the population as a member of the
leadership of the Caldari State, Tibus Heth mourned the passing of Otro
Gariushi and the fallen of Malkalen, now numbering over 600,000 dead,
and then declared a quarantine of all Gallente expatriates within State
borders. This move was not opposed by any of the other Big Eight
mega-corporations.

### Republic Tensions

In other empires, while the Caldari's May Revolution and the Malkalen
Disaster was watched carefully, serious events merited the immediate
attention of the Amarr Empire and the Minmatar Republic. Increasing
attacks on Amarr shipping in Minmatar territory throughout May had
caused disquiet enough, but a new upsurge in Defiants activity in the
Bleak Lands caused serious diplomatic friction. In particular, the
presence of informal 'Minmatar militias' bolstering the forces of the
Defiants rebels in fighting against the Amarr 7th Fleet awoke the Amarr
Empire's wrath.

While the Minmatar Republic denied any support for the Defiants, the
Amarr Empire's representatives at the CONCORD Assembly demanded that the
Republic curb the Defiants and any militias. With a sense of timing not
lost on the Amarr Empire or the Caldari State, the Republic and the
Gallente Federation began large-scale fleet exercises in the Metropolis
region using the none-too-subtle name of 'Operation Brotherhood.'

Any confidence Operation Brotherhood may have given the Minmatar
Republic, however, was wiped out when the Angel Cartel declared itself
the sovereign power of Skarkon, a Republic system on the border of 0.0
space in the Cartel's sphere of influence. Even though CONCORD dismissed
the claims as illegitimate, the Republic looked powerless to intervene
as the population of Skarkon welcomed the change, having been neglected
for years by Republic authorities.

### Yulai Incursion

The final act of the May Revolution came as the arc of Keitan Yun's
career blazed into a prominence no mere ambassador could hope for. On
the twenty-ninth of May, the Kaalakiota-Ytiri conglomerate agreed on
strategic partnerships with all the other Big Eight mega-corporations,
save for Ishukone. With this agreement, Tibus Heth's Caldari Providence
Directorate gained control of the vast majority of the Caldari State's
industrial base. A unity not seen in the State for decades had been
achieved, and would soon be improved on yet further.

The penultimate day of May bore witness to two extraordinary events. One
of them transfixed the attention of all and eclipsed the other, rather
quieter and almost resigned occurence. Both were important in
understanding what was to come. At approximately 110.05.30 10:30, an
armada of Minmatar ships jumped into the Yulai system without using any
of the system's stargates. Within seconds a fleet composed of multiple
Naglafar-class dreadnoughts bearing Republic Fleet markings, but
broadcasting no identifiers, surrounded the CONCORD Bureau Station,
escorted by many [Thukker Tribe](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z) vessels
equally bereft of electronic identifiers. Only a few minutes after their
arrival and menacing encirclement of the CONCORD headquarters, the
mystery capitals and escorts jumped out of the system without a shot
being fired.

As CONCORD grappled with the pressing question of quite how an entire
armada had jumped into the most secure system in New Eden, without using
gates and bypassing cynosural suppression fields with contemptuous ease,
the news of the nature of the ships raised equally urgent questions for
the Minmatar Republic and Prime Minister Karin Midular. The revelation
later in the day that Keitan Yun, the disgraced Minmatar Ambassador to
CONCORD, had spoken to CONCORD authorities just before and during the
Yulai Incursion with apparent knowledge of the purposes of the mystery
fleet, only intensified pressue on the Midular administration.
Disavowing Yun and denying the involvement of any Republic Fleet assets
in the incident, Karin Midular appeared to many observers to cut a
bewildered figure losing control of the Republic, its institutions and
its people.

As the impact of the Yulai Incursion made itelf felt, the second
extraordinary event of the day passed with relatively little notice.
Still in mourning and administratively crippled, the Ishukone
Corporation agreed to grant strategic control of its industrial
operations to the Caldari Providence Directorate, completing the May
Revolution and bringing all Caldari megacorporations under the effective
control of Tibus Heth. For the first time in centuries, the Caldari were
controlled by one man, with the question for many being whether he was
the saviour of the Caldari nation or its newly-crowned tyrant.
