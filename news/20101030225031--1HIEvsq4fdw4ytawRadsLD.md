At 20:00 New Eden Time today, over 2,300 capsuleers from the Northern Coalition and Legion of xXDEATHXx engaged in battle over the 'Iridium Plaza' outpost.  
  
A Fleet Commander for the Northern Coalation commented that Legion of xXDEATHXx members appeared to be breaking off the engagement, "they tried to jump out but they seemed to have more issues with [spatial anomolies] then we did".  
  
Northern Coalition forces have been waiting for 'Iridium Plaza' to exit reinforced mode to begin their second assault on the station..[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4194/filenamethumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4194/filenamethumb.png)  
  
At 21:25 'Iridium Plaza Station' was under heavy assault by around 1,300 capsuleers of whom a majority were members of the Northern Coalition.  
  
At 22:10 Legion of xXDEATHXx's members still have made no major attempts to defend the system, and their station continues to take heavy damage.  
  
'Iridium Plaza Station' is expected to fall in the early hours of tomorrow morning.
