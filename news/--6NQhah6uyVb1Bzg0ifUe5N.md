# Mining Colonies
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/mining-colonies

**Mining colonies** use equipment which creates sounds which can be
heard throughout the colony and may be described as a "buzzing, grinding
sound, like flies in a jar."

They often have their own local police force. Justice meted out by the
same is sometimes specialized and often brutal.

Residences located in mining colonies have private water showers, but
laundry facilities are communal and designed to conserve water.
