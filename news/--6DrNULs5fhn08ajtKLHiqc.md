# Omicron Incident

The **Omicron Incident** is one of [the Broker's](35XiT6V98vAeV9AdpZyl72) most celebrated feats:

At the time two feudal [Amarr](2DkiJVfiL1RYP5y7AJGSNN) lords ruling
adjacent domains at the fringes of the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
were clashing over the privilege to extend their domains to include that
of another feudal lord, recently deceased. The Broker, going by the name
Aeron Assis, had just concluded a contract to buy a large quantity of
[Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) and [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
manufactured weapons. He was looking for prospective buyers and decided
the two Amarr lords to be ideal. The problem was that the two lords were
just about to reach an agreement on dividing the disputed territories
between them. The Broker acted fast and produced documents claiming that
one of the lords, [Hurid-Akan](2r9xQ4PXX5AiOYRdVw9sZn), had been
conspiring to have the other lord, [Kirion](7sZCtX9JZqc6dkDvQrehtS),
assassinated.

The news infuriated Kirion and made him break off all negotiations with
Hurid-Akan. Determined to strike the iron while still hot the Broker set
out for Hurid-Akan's domain and leaked (false) information to
Hurid-Akan's intelligence arm that Kirion had broken of the negotiations
because he intended to invade and occupy the disputed territories with
the aid of an undisclosed ally. Hurid-Akan was hesitant to take up arms
he considered his army too ill-equipped to be an efficient fighting
force. But to his immense relief he learned that a Caldari arms dealer
was visiting his capital (this was of course the Broker in yet another
disguise). The Broker sold Hurid-Akan top-of-the-line
[Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) weapons and then left, again heading for
Kirion's domain. Meanwhile, Hurid-Akan hurriedly began mobilizing his
armed forces.

Kirion, alarmed by the mobilization of Hurid-Akan's forces, began his
own preparations for war. The Broker leaked the information about the
advanced Caldari weapons Hurid-Akan had bought to Kirion and then
proceeded to sell him Gallente weaponry as counter measures.

For days, the Broker played the two lords against each other, employing
a combination of falsified surveillance data, forged documents
describing imaginary plots and plans and his net of agents and
double-agents within both domains to increase the paranoia of the lords
so they'd buy more of his weapons. In the end, the [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ), notified of the increased tension in
the region, was forced to sent a royal arbitrator to calm things down.
By that time the two lords spent their entire fortune buying all of the
Broker's weapons and the Broker himself had quietly disappeared from the
Empire. This was not to be the last time that the Broker ingeniously
played factions against each other for his own benefit.

As the years have passed the Broker himself has become increasingly
paranoid of keeping his identity and whereabouts hidden. His vast
information net and accumulated wealth has made this relatively easy for
him and today he works almost entirely through middlemen in his wheeling
and dealing in the outer world. He is still considered to be very
active, but the extent of his operation is for anybody to guess.
