# Trevor Kekkonen

Trevor Kekkonen was a [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) scientist and
spaceship captain. He was not a [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ), but
used [cybernetics](6gvL4Ytgm3vJN7gvP6akTd) to compensate for
that fact. He was 11 years old when the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
bombed [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i). He was orphaned as a
result, having personally witnessed the death of his parents in the
bombardment. He was evacuated from Caldari Prime by a Caldari ship, and
went on to graduate at the top of his class from the [School of Applied Knowledge](1mpxZ1xQASwfKEIiB65lDW) in
[Todaki](6fVtwziKR3ywX6495d0iuj), where he demonstrated remarkable natural
talent for research and science. His experiences on Caldari Prime left
deep mental scars, and he had regular recurring nightmares of that time
and the death of his parents.

He could not qualify to become a capsuleer, but overcame the cerebral
deficiencies preventing him from effective starship command through the
use of cybernetic implants, and eventually qualified to captain both
Caldari and Gallente [cruiser-class](3wE5sDRggwgYjiExdCRyL0) ships. He
gained outstanding combat records against the
[Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) and [Serpentis](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs)
pirate organizations, earning him high marks with both the Caldari and
Gallente governments. He developed extensive connections with quality
personnel from some of the most powerful corporations in both states,
including [Ishukone](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI), [Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK), [CreoDron](3lCriaLYr0Nrmj9pkru5Z3) and [Duvolle Laboratories](1khBWLK52GfHvRQ1xUrOPb).

Due to his intense emotional scars lasting from the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV), Trevor covertly dedicated his
life to labor for the eventual destruction of the [ethnic Gallente](3V8a3iCXmTydxJIORMLTtM). His
life's ambition was to be able to speak the words "Never again" to the
defeated remnants of the Federation, and he believed that science
would one day grant him his wish. He identified two obstacles on his
path to vengeance - first: he needed a detailed understanding of the
strengths and weaknesses of both Gallente and Caldari technology,
especially regarding starship engineering methods; and second: it would
require bleeding-edge scientific breakthroughs that could be used to
tilt the balance of power forever in favor of the Caldari State.

The first obstacle he overcame through his studies and mastery of ships
and science from both sides. The second obstacle he could only engage
following the [Crielere Research Laboratories'](3Y34ZySL2hebLjco1Y25IK) discovery
of the mineral morphite and the potential applications of its
extraordinary chemical properties. Once that path was laid open to him,
he could set about exploring the possibilities he sought.

To pursue his scientific projects, he employed research agents from all
of the major inventive corporations he had built connections with.
Although he realized that science was, by nature, a very methodical
process that could never be rushed, his impositions were especially
harsh on the Gallente agents under his employ. Among them were [Orsetta Lexmoreau](6X2MS3haT7Ufi8eTAlpilz), whom he worked with at the
CreoDron factory at [Atlulle III](2Jtkm8UAtWTObh0P1SkFi2). He had
Orsetta's team working on several projects, and they completed at least
one blueprint based on his scientific
theories.
