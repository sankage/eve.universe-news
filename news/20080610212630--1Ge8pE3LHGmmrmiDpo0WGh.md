Not long after the assault on Andrub, reports from eyewitnesses across the Kor Azor region have been filtering back claiming a "frightening lack of cohesion" in the already troubled Imperial forces. It is understood that the crippled Ministry of War station served as a central hub for regional defence command and is now offline. According to reports, the removal of this vital link in the Amarrian defence network has left regional defence forces in complete disarray. 

In perhaps the most startling rumor to suggest this may be true, reports are coming back of two Archon-class carriers colliding outside the Ministry of War station moments after communications lines went dead.
