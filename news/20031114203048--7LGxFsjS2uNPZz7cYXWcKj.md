Expert ship builders of the Imperial Fleet Assembly Plants are working day and night completing a batch of ships that were expected for delivery this weekend at the Amarr Championship Award Ceremony. Due to an unfortunate incident at the docks, delivery of the fleet was postponed. An experimental new power core of an Imperial class battleship overheated, torching dozens of slave shipbuilders to their death. One Amarrian engineer was somewhat injured, causing the Amarrian Imperial Succession Council much distress. As a result, the council found it necessary to delay the Championship award ceremony, which was to take place this weekend, as the champions and their wingmen would not receive all their ships in time. According to Ammarri officials, the ceremony is expected to take place in one week from now.
