During fleet operations on the 12th, a detachment of vessels belonging to the members of the **_State Protectorate (STPRO)_** travelled through hostile space to assist the **_24th Imperial Crusade (24IC)_** in their conflict with the **_Tribal Liberation Force (TLIB)_**. 

The STPRO fleet of 140+ vessels joined with the 24IC fleet to make a combined fleet of almost 200 vessels. This joint fleet executed a pincer movement, coming upon the TLIB fleet in Otelen and totally decimating it with only minor losses. 

Once again this fleet was lead by Protectorate Ensign Boromor.
