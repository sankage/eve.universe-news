**Lazar** is a crew member on board a [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ)
ship whose crew has a unique approach to assimilating new members.

Hiring to capsuleer crew
------------------------

Prior to becoming a crew member, he lived an unspectacular, unfulfilling
life in a [colony](6NQhah6uyVb1Bzg0ifUe5N). One day, he decided to
sign on with a ship that had visited the colony regularly. He was taken
on by the ship, an industrial with a capsuleer who treated his crew very
well. Lazar signed on for a yearlong tour, though the recruiters told
him that people rarely left after the year is up.

Start of crew tenure
--------------------

For the initial few weeks onboard, Lazar was assigned to a small
subsection of the ship, an arrangement intended to last until he could
become accustomed to his new life. He was not allowed to bring personal
possessions on board, and was provided with all necessities. He noted
that there are no mirrors on board.

Associations with crew
----------------------

During this time, the rest of the crew he worked with were watching him
and judging his skills. He made friends with several other crew members
and became romantically attracted to a woman named
[Reania](7eX5QRS588u2ODYM4YGbhu), with whom he hit it off and became close
friends. She called the ship's capsuleer kooky, but kind, and agreed
that the lack of mirrors was strange.

Onset of illness
----------------

Eventually, Lazar started to grow ill, witnessing small glowing spots in
his room that followed his vision. He seemed to grow worse over the
following days, a progression he believed was evident judging by how
often others asked him how he was doing. He began vomiting at night and
continued to hallucinate.

One day, a stranger sat next to him at lunch and acted as if he knew
him. Lazar questioned the man, who reveals himself to be
[Jatek](3t5pFetPlx67RxvKo8AqfN), one of Lazar's friends who had supposedly
left the ship days before. Lazar noted the man was nearly identical
physically, save for having a completely different face. Jatek seemed to
realize this, but apparently had no issue with the change, which greatly
disturbed Lazar. When another person, [Kralen](6nV0v83P5bLeXg8irJ40kV),
walked in with the same face, Lazar ran off to vomit.

Worsening of illness
--------------------

That night Renia came to care for him, and while they rested in Lazar's
quarters, Lazar questioned her about Jatek and Kralen. She did not note
anything wrong with them.

Over the coming days, more people appeared with the new faces. Lazar
believed himself to be going mad, and flaked out during an attack on the
ship. Though the ship survived and went to a station for repairs, Lazar
was rattled, and was wandering around the ship in a daze, when a man
with the now-familiar face approaches him. Lazar, however, believed this
man's particular face fit his body, unlike the others.

The man reassured him, declaring, "We are all the same here. We all live
this same life. Forever." Lazar was strangely comforted by this and
realizes, as the man walked away, that he was was the ship's capsuleer.

Prosopagnosia
-------------

That night, Reania visited him and offered additional comfort, assuring
him he was not mad. The two slept together and subsequently spent every
night together for some time.

One night, she told him she was going to leave for a while. Lazar
accepted this and settled into his life onboard the ship, this time
being of more use - including pulling Jatek away from a circuit board
fire during another ship fight.

When Reania returned, it was in the dark in the middle of the night. As
they started to make love, Lazar turned on the lights and saw Reania now
had the same face as everyone else. When he saw his reflection in her
eyes, he realized he too had the very same face, and seemed pleased with
this revelation.
