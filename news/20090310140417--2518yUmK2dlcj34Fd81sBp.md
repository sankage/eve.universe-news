God's Righteousness Conclave, an Amarrian fundamentalist group, released a follow-up statement moments ago. "We warned of the dangers of associating with heretics, and yet thousands responded to help.  
  
God's warning against iniquity and sin was not heeded, and the consequences shall now be paid. While we mourn any loss of life, those lost in the Seyllin system shall serve as a stark reminder to both the glory and power of God. It is through that sole path of purity that heresy and its support are punished."  
  
Amarr government officials would not comment directly on the group's statement, directing reporters to Empress Jamyl's previous statements regarding the situation in Seyllin.
