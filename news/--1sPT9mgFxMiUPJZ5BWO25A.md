# Terden
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/terden

**Terden** was a [Sansha](6dFZYDkE3R4BRF9w21mtjP) scout. Before he
joined the Nation, he worked at an [old colony](7F4mXQ0x2Q4fCORw8MKm3W)
under the man [Melvue](3lGS0xpEmMiYeWCooS7r4O), and appears to have lived
with [Fermar's](7cLMQC182YuCCSfazxcPbY) family. It's unclear when Terden
joined the Nation, but he appears to have been present at the old colony
when Melvue sold it out.

When he met Fermar at the [new colony](6cqzYEL9lVMn6APNJMCzvT), he was
dressed in black, stylish in a fairly classical way and covered with a
mop of dark, curly hair; noticeable, all in all, but not memorable. He
was younger than Fermar by at least thirty years, but didn't carry
himself with the same bullish assurance. Fermar moved like a man used to
high gravity; this one sidled like someone expecting the sky to pick him
up at any time.

As an advance scout, Terden's job was often to approach colony managers
like Fermar and ask them to cut a deal with the Nation to minimize
casualties. Fermar shot and killed him before enacting his plan to
destroy the Sansha raiding party in a trap.
