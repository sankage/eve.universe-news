++ TRANSMISSION FROM ADMIRAL JONAR OF THE REPUBLIC FLEET ++

++ TO ALL TRIBAL LIBERATION FORCE PILOTS ++

Pilots of the TLF,

Most of you have read about the disaster in the Aset system.  The Fleet is currently redeploying its forces to assist and ensure that the exact position of the disaster is kept secret.  This should ensure our enemies cannot disrupt the rescue.

We do not wish to take any chances, however, so I am asking that the Tribal Liberation Force assist with patrols in keeping the Aset system as free from enemy encroachment as possible.  I know you are particularly hard-pressed in these times, but the Fleet has the utmost confidence in your abilities. We trust we can rely on you to assist us in this endeavor.

For Matar, For Freedom.

Admiral Jonar
