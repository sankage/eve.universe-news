Professor **Reymonde Foucalt** is a lecturer on
[drone](3o5QhCbx71nILKNnW9S7v1) technology.

He came to renown when he was accused of
[fedophilia](1ZTrrDLEL9V2OvHNc8NMkY) and encouraging his mistress,
[Liberienne Houlliente](S5FNvi9zL0pZqb1r77X2C), to dress in a
fedo suit and wear fedo pheromones for kinky games. The allegation
was later proven to be completely false, and Liberienne found to be
receiving money from a rival drone manufacturer.
