# Maleatu Shakor
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/maleatu-shakor

Maleatu Shakor, current leader of the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp),
is the descendant of a [Defiant](6aq75j8f7bMZckaqXWXSC6), a group of
[Brutors](brutor-tribe) active during the
[Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N).

Like many of the Defiants descendants, he suffers a common genetic eye
disease similar to glaucoma. While easily repaired, some, including
Maleatu, let the disease go untreated either in deference to the
sacrifice their ancestors made, or as a gesture of respect.

As a young squadron commander he showed tactical brilliance, devising
the Shakor's spiral formation. He led raids in
[Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) space before moving his operations to a
secret base in the [Great Wildlands](great-wildlands).
He was ambushed by the Amarr Royal Guard who killed all of his men and
would have killed him as well if not for the [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) who
rescued him, held him two years, and returned him a changed, calmer man.

Maleatu later became the leader of the Republic, abolishing Parliament
and reinstituting the title of [Sanmatar](180IYq6xQy0PzfGH6hLEuO).
