### Drifters Attack Systems Across Cluster
Drifter-controlled forces have attacked solar systems in all four major nations. The attacks have focused on civilian infrastructure, triggering the deployment of military crisis response forces. Initial strikes by the Drifters have already led to a death toll in the thousands, with that number expected to climb as the violence continues. 

The motivation behind the Drifter aggression is unclear. The targeted systems are of little strategic significance, there are no signs of permanent occupation, and no resources are being extracted by either the Drifters or the Sleeper Drones under their control. The only clue to the Drifters' goals are the surveillance structures at the heart of their efforts. Named “Vigilant Dreamers”, these structures appear to be the focal points of Drifter activity in affected systems. Defending forces are attempting to gather sufficient intel to pinpoint and ultimately destroy these Dreamers. 

Military leaders of the Amarr, Caldari, Gallente, and Minmatar alike have called on capsuleers to aid them in their counteroffensives against what is being called the Drifter Crisis. Operations are being broadcasted to Capsuleers from Crisis systems via their AIR Opportunities interfaces.

### Gallente Districts Adapt With Federation Support
Throughout the Federation, districts have been thrown into turmoil by Drifter strikes. Local administrations have been forced to reorganize using emergency procedures put in place by President Celes Aguard’s Crisis Management team.

Today’s attacks have silenced many who questioned President Aguards decision to postpone the Federation’s regularly scheduled elections. Only the Federalist-Liberal Party has remained vocal in their criticism, accusing the President of using an atmosphere of fear to disrupt the lawful democratic process. Her own party, the Progressive Unionists, have dismissed these claims, praising Aguard for putting the defense of the Federation first.

The President herself spoke at a press conference on Luminaire today, praising the “dedication and bravery” of those who have taken up the fight against the Drifters. When questioned she was reluctant to give a definitive answer on the rescheduling of the election, stating that “this crisis has only just begun”. 

### Caldari State “Stands As One” in Face of Threat
Speaking aboard a Chimera class carrier, Chairman Akimaka Saraki has commended the Caldari Navy for its speedy deployment to all systems in conflict. He added that “the very best of the State cannot be distracted from their sworn duty.” 

Some political pundits took the comment as a disparaging reference to those who criticized the CEP for relying on Gallente intel. Saraki issued a second statement dismissing this analysis as divisive and unfounded. This statement began, “We are one Caldari. Never is this truer than when we find ourselves tested by unprecedented times. As long as we stand as one, none may stand against us.”

### Holders Invest at Empress' Behest 
Across the Amarr Empire, newly deployed joint holder assets have moved to meet Drifter forces. Organized in secret, these newly formed armadas pool the resources of local nobility to enable timely countermeasures. Able to respond more rapidly than Imperial forces, they are part of a strategy that puts responsivity first. 

Empress Catiz I has been credited with this logistical innovation. In an Empire-wide broadcast, she commended all Amarrian citizens for their “fortitude in the face of darkness.” She called on “all faithful to band together against the demonic abborations that plague our skies. In years past, these same monstrosities breached our borders and murdered our holy Empress Jamyl I. They caught us by surprise, but this time we are ready to show them the truth of our Lord’s will.”

### Republic Scrambles to Respond
The Republic Fleet has scrambled to defend clan holdings under attack. Thukker Chief Ennar Aeboul has criticized Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor and the Tribal council for failing to heed his tribe’s warnings of a rising Drifter threat. “We who wander are tired of being overlooked,” he told reporters, “It brings me great sorrow that innocent Matari must now pay such a high price for the Republic’s foolishness.”

The Sanmatar has deflected these criticisms, saying that “now is the time for unity. Despite what Aeboul might think, the Republic Fleet is always ready to defend our people. We should be focussed on how to support them, not casting aspersions.”

### Deathless Circle Blamed By SOCT
As the nations of New Eden respond to the Drifter threat, their representatives are being hosted at an emergency CONCORD summit in Yulai. As diplomats headed into session, the Society of Conscious Thought’s Elder Mentor Matshi Raish spoke to the press, laying the blame for the ongoing crisis at the feet of the Deathles Circle. 

“These Drifter attacks are the direct result of the Deathless and his Circle’s reckless hubris. Their occupation of the Fulcrum and Warden structures has clearly awoken a threat that long lay dormant. Through their interference with technologies beyond their understanding they have unleashed tragedy upon our cluster.”

Rumors have spread that the Deathless Cricle are attempting to take advantage of the current situation by deploying research outposts within Crisis systems, only to come under attack by the Drifters themselves. While calls for aid have been registered, military forces are encouraging capsuleers to bring any research produced at Circle facilities to national intelligence agencies, and not to aid the criminal organization.

### New in Brief
