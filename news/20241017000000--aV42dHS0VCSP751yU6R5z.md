### SOCT Responds to Deathless Request for Atavum
The SOCT has issued an official message to all capsuleers in response to the Deathless' recent request for Atavum. Mysterious devices left behind by ancient Jovian explorers, Atavum have been discovered in relic sites all across New Eden and wormhole space. Idmei Sver, CEO of the Society, urges pilots to bring their Atavum to Society of Conscious Thought stations in FDZ4-A instead of delivering them into Deathless hands. Here is the message in full:

*To the Capsuleers of New Eden.*

*We have always strived to foster a deeper understanding of our universe and preserve humanity’s path to a more enlightened future, regardless of creed or country. Since the withdrawal of our patrons from the Third Jovian Empire, we have not wavered from this mission. But not all paths lead to enlightenment. There are corruptors in our world whose only goal is to spread misrule and thrust us into darkness.* 

*The so-called “Deathless” is one such agent, and he seeks to consume and foul the pure technologies of the ancient Jove, technologies that are our shared legacy. Take for example the Fulcrum he resides in. Once a silent monolith to a long-lost past, it has been perverted into a den of iniquity. Now he demands these Atavum so he can squander the history they represent and pervert them to his base purposes.*

*We at the Society wish only to protect and preserve these ancient treasures so that their secrets might be used responsibly. I implore you, bold empyreans, to bring any Atavum you discover to the Society instead. You will be fairly compensated for your deliveries and can be at peace knowing they will be safely stored far from any ill intent. We trust that you, whose new lives were built on secrets shared by our former patrons, will do what is right for New Eden.*

The message came in response to reports of capsuleers trading in Atavum at a research station beside the recently discovered shrouded structure in Zarzakh. At this research station, the Deathless Circle has been passing out upgraded combat probes, relic analyzer and implant blueprint copies, and valuable honorarium in exchange for Atavum. Inside sources have indicated that the Circle intends to study these Atavum in order to learn how to unlock the mysterious structure. Given their past association with criminal organizations, the Scope is awaiting further confirmation of these reports.

### Journals and Atavum Buy Orders
The SOCT has issued buy orders in their FDZ4-A stations, offering compensation to anyone who delivers Atavum to their archives. They have also extended this offer to include old journal data that has also been discovered recently in relic sites. 

These journals were penned by a former member of the SOCT. Speaking on behalf of the Society Idmei Sver stated that they would be “grateful for the timely recovery of any information this member of our Society left behind.” According to him as the journals were made by a member of their organization, they are SOCT property.
