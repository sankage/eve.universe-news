**Bioencryption** is a security method that requires biological data to
unlock encryption routines. It covers a wide range of devices, such as
fingerprint and retina scans, right up to DNA and full body scans, that
are used to unlock anything from doors and compartments, to computer
files and operating programs.

Historical Background
---------------------

While devices of this type have been around for a very long time in all
empires, the introduction of [cloning](cloning) technologies
saw a rapid change in this field. While much of a persons biological
data carries over to a clone, some methods of comparison have proven
unreliable. Fingerprints and retina scans in particular proved
difficult, and as such, there has been a marked increase in blood and
DNA sampling devices, particularly on stations and facilities used
primarily by [capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ).
