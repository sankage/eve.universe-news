In a hastily-assembled statement to the press, Sister Elaya Selnaarei urged the cluster not to panic amidst the pandemonium in Yulai.

"We must remain calm," she stated. "I urge all nations to let cool heads prevail at this time and act in the interests of all inhabitants across the universe. As always, our organization is ready to provide aid in these troubled times. Convoys to Yulai are already enroute and will respond to any and all requests for assistance."
