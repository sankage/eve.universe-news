Earlier today an overloaded transport vessel bumped into some vital components of the outer docking mechanism at Raneilles VI - Moon 14 - Core Complexion Inc. Factory station. Damages to the docks were fortunately minimal but the ships hull was severely damaged causing a massive spill of the cargo of garbage. Cleaning is under way but until all the mess has been cleared up pilots are advised to stay clear of Raneilles VI - Moon 14 - Core Complexion Inc. Factory station or risk being stuck there for some time.
