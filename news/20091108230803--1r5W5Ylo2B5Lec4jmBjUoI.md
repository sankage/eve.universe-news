 **Abudban, Heimatar** - On 1st November, G.A.N.J.A. commenced with their first violent protest against the Minmatar Republic, targeting the transport convoys within the Abudban system. Two Chandlers, two Traffickers and one Merchant became the first casualties.  
  
[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3527/ganjaithumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=)After previous [peaceful demonstrations](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3472&tid=7) failed to garner a response, G.A.N.J.A. moved their plans forward and attacked three regions simultaneously within the Minmatar Republic in what they hoped would damage the Minmatar economy in retribution for damage done to Ammatar farmers during The Elder Invasion of YC110.  
  
On this night alone, there were a total of 26 ships destroyed with an estimated total value of 11.000.000 ISK, with approximately 5.500.000 ISK worth of goods salvaged from the wrecks. By selling the goods recovered from the convoys they destroy, G.A.N.J.A. hopes to stimulate trade and improve the local Ammatar economy.  
  
While scouting for another convoy to attack, Severed Savior, a High Scholar within G.A.N.J.A. said: "As our membership grows, we can raid [more]; we plan some daring raids into the heart of the so-called Republic. Of course we cannot disclose pending operations, but they will be spectacular."  
  
G.A.N.J.A. hopes for more support from capsuleers as their protests become more widespread and violent. With no official response to G.A.N.J.A.'s demands, it remains to be seen how far G.A.N.J.A. are willing to go in their protest.
