According to Kelduum Reevan, the change will not dampen the University's activities. "This is more a formal hand over of the official title than anything else," he said, adding that courses are proceding smoothly and they are still receiving tens of applications daily.   
  
Both students and teachers at the university confirm the change in leadership is not altering their schedule.   
  
Aquadictus, Rear Admiral of the University's Navy, explained that capsuleers need to be able to keep up no matter who is in charge. Asremar, a one-month old student, added he has mainly been taught under the upcoming CEO. "Since I'm new, I can't vouch for the older students, however, I know many loved our retiring CEO," he said.   
  
Finally, Morning Maniac expressed satisfation with what Eve University has become: "When I founded [it], I had no idea where it would go. Where we are today is far beyond anything I could have imagined... All thanks to you, members past and present of Eve University," he concluded.
