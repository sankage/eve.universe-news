Industrial tycoons running manufacture space stations are ecstatic over the high demand for the factory service they provide. Being true capitalists the tycoons have decided to raise the rental cost for their factory slots. It is expected that price for renting factory slots may rise as much as 800% in some areas, less in others. Manufacturers have already started to complain about the pending rent increase, while the tycoons where last seen laughing all the way to the bank. The rent increase will come into full force tomorrow and experts predict that this will have minimal effects on the extreme demand.
