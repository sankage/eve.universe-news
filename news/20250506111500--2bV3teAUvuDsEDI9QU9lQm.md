### Wrath of Tyrannos Begins

Drifter activity has intensified across New Eden as forces previously seen only in the five Drifter wormholes have begun to appear across the cluster. As the factions occupying Drifter wormhole space have kept up the pressure, retaliatory sites have appeared all across New Eden. 

Tyrannos Strategos, leader of the Drifters' Vigilant Tyrannos, has been sighted in her dreadnought protecting newly appeared Hive structures at Locus Points in lowsec systems. These vast rings are not yet active, and Labyrinth Complexes similar to those observed in Drifter wormhole space have been spotted throughout higher security space. According to SOCT hyperspace telemetry, these Labyrinths are directing higher-dimensional traffic to the Hives within Locus Points as part of the Drifters' attempts to bring the sites online.

With higher-dimensional sites now descending into k-space, the factions occupying Drifter wormholes have established new trading posts to take advantage of objects of interest collected by capsuleers who enter those sites. As they are further removed from the primary occupation strongholds in wormhole space, exchange rates at these traders are less favorable than those found inside the occupied Drifter wormhole systems. Located within the capital systems of each faction, these trading posts are; the Amarr Anointed Allocator, New Caldari State Trader, Pator Liberation Quartermaster, Raravoss Kybernaut Glorification Xordazh, and the Yulai Secured Requisition Officer.

The four major nations have called on capsuleers to rally in the defense of this space against this unprecedented threat to K-space. The Gallente, who were unable to gain a foothold in Drifter wormhole space, have mounted operations against Drifters following a press conference held by President Celes Aguard.

“Citizens and friends of the Federation, do not allow our envious enemies to taint your perceptions with their words. While we may have faced some challenges in recent days, the Federation remains as resilient as ever, and we are committed to recovering from our setbacks. As I address you now, the Federation is mobilizing its defenses to counter what we hope to be a final assault by Drifter forces.”

Critics have accused the President of grandstanding following her failures to establish a strong research program during last month's “Race for the Hives.” A failure that resulted in the Gallente being the only one of the four major nations not to claim a Drifter wormhole.

Shortly after her address, Caldari State Militia gained control over the Ouperia “Old Man Star” system after 3 years of Gallente occupation, leading to additional, mostly non-violent protests in Caille targeting President Aguard for her alleged incompetence.
