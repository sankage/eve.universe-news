HEDION - Calling it "God's cleansing fire," a vocal Amarr fundamentalist group has released a statement in the wake of reports of the catastrophic solar event in Seyllin. The statement, released by the God's Righteousness Conclave, was transmitted minutes ago, drawing a mixture of support and ire from populations.  
  
"The event in Seyllin has long been foretold by the scriptures. Those who deny God's will and those who support heresy are subject to His judgment. The fury and the wrath of the Seyllin star is God's cleansing fire, brought down on the heretic nation with a righteous vengeance. Consequences have been made clear, and the path of safety is clear!"
