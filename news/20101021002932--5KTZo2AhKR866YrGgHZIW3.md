Earlier this month a Kronos-class marauder owned by mission runner Willbur was destroyed by capsuleer pirates in the Irjunen solar system. The loss is estimated at about 19.7 Billion ISK.  
  
Willbur, a member of IMpAct Corporation, was assaulted by ten members of 'The Inf1dels'. The pirate fleet was comprised of eight Raven's, one Tempest, and one Armageddon.  
  
Some of the more expensive modules that were lost in the attack included; Chelm's Modified Cap Recharger, (8,000.00 M ISK), Selynne's Modified Cap Recharger (3,050.00 M ISK), Brokara's Modified Cap Recharger (1,800.00 M ISK), Chelm's Modified Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane (2,800.00 M ISK), Centus X-Type Large Armor Repairer (1,350.00 M ISK) and two Corpum A-Type Energized Adaptive Nano Membranes (1,200.00 M ISK).  
  
Willbur was in seemingly good spirits after the loss, describing The Inf1dels attack as a "good shot", and expressing his surprise after the attack; "I didn't know that it was possible to [kill] a sturdy battleship inside the empire. [New Eden] will always surprise me. And that's what makes [it] exciting."
