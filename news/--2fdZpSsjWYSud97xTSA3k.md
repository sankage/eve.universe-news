# Pier Ancru
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/pier-ancru

Pier Ancru was the chairman of the board of [Pend Insurance](3MEqbUgJsCwlfehyXJFrFN) and a major stockholder in the company. As a prominent figure in the leadership of Pend Insurance, Ancru had apartments in all of their main stations. He was an early
adopter of jump clone technology, and used it to take frequent leisure
trips, preferring that mode of travel over normal spaceflight. Ancru was
left-handed, but still ate as if he was right-handed, something which
allowed him to prove his innocence and identity when confronted by
Police Commissioner [Jilaine Garat](1Tsx0YteREP4IeCwyOuPLF) about the
assassination of Senator [Papadour](69n0W6mbkdWGRzBYwHrUSZ) in Palmon.
