**"Crazy"** is the name give to a [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) man by [Sebastian](5XvDRS1t6l5P9mK4ycTU6S). A live wire, this man has a slightly high pitched voice and wears tattered shoes and pants and when his shirt is unbuttoned it reveals a ribcage that looks like a toaster rack. His short hair stands up on end, his eyes are wide and unblinking, and when he smiles his upper gums show.

He used a nutcracker to break bones in Sebastian's hands, calling it an 'alligator'.
