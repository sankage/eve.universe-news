# New Eden Cluster
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/new-eden-cluster

**New Eden** is the name for the star cluster which is inhabited by the
human race. The term is colloquial in nature, as the name is alternately
applied to every star system in the galactic neighborhood, only those
that have been explored and cataloged by humans, or solely those which
are currently connected by working [stargate](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk)
networks. In common usage, the last definition is most frequently meant,
and is the definition used in this article.

Structure
---------

New Eden is a loosely-bound cluster of stars approximately 106 light
years long, 90 light years wide, and 25 light years thick. The cluster
contains 5,433 star systems with stargate connections, though
significantly more stars and stellar remnants with no gate connections
exist within. Because stargates are almost exclusively deployed in star
systems with orbital bodies, every star system within New Eden has at
least one planet. It similarly contains many black holes, neutron stars,
and white dwarfs, but these have also been mostly left unconnected to
the stargate system. The cluster is relatively densely packed, with the
average system having at least one neighbor less than a light year away
from it. It is composed of stars of all stellar classifications and
ages.

When looking at charted star maps, explorers often notice a filamentary
structure to the cluster, especially at its edges. This leads some to
believe that there are massive voids of stars within the cluster, but
this is only partly true. Many of these gaps are filled with stars which
have simply not been connected to the rest of the cluster through
stargates. Such gaps are occasionally "filled in", most recently when
the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) opened several connecting gates
to Black Rise. Some voids are actually devoid
of stars, such as [Divinity's Edge](1ZlQT0vWU0K0WiiGrew2cU), or are
in the midst of heavy stellar formation, such as with the [Vapor Sea](3iAejc9wCucgaKqw0F1pP0).

History
-------

### Colonization and Collapse

Archeological evidence implies human beings first visited New Eden
roughly 15,000 years ago. The exact mechanism by which humans ventured
into the cluster is unknown, though evidence points to the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o), located in the system from which the cluster
takes its name, as the entryway. It appears these early settlers,
over a period of roughly one-hundred years, colonized planets throughout
the cluster, until a sudden disaster apparently struck them. The exact
nature of this disaster is unknown, but it was catastrophic enough that
within a few generations, the technology of the settlements had
regressed significantly.

### Dark Ages

Over the intervening centuries, the majority of the settlements died
out. A few managed to survive and slowly began to regain their lost
technology. The first of these are the people who would come to be known
as the [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G). The Jove are notoriously secretive and
have shared little of their history. They once inhabited the region
known as [Curse](Curse-(lore)) during their First Empire.
Following the contraction of a malady known as the [Jovian Disease](23mdEc1035XOWRcmorPJYf), they abandoned the area in an
attempt to escape the affliction. Roughly 3000 years ago, Miko Bour
united them in a Second Empire.

At some other point, at least three other ancient civilizations rose to
power. Today, they are known mainly by the artifacts and ruins they left
behind, with little knowledge of what caused them to rise and eventually
vanish from the cluster's landscape. They are known as the Sleepers, [Talocan](7jRYunEKgSJvxgaC4vjVUM),
and [Yan Jung](7BfXQleikGcLtKuut5CzHW), though the recent discovery of
wormhole space has provided tantalizing clues about the fates of the
Sleepers and Talocan. A fourth ancient civilization, the
[Takmahl](3Xi3M3G5tNTRfcqYESe5aP), arose later as an offshoot of
[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) exiles.

### Rise of the Empires

#### Amarr Empire

The next civilization to emerge from the dark ages were the Amarr, who
had conquered their [home planet](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4). Just over
two-thousand years ago, they rediscovered space flight and began
exploring their home system. Soon after, they discovered an intact
stargate within their system and successfully reverse engineered the
technology. In 21290 AD, they constructed the first modern stargate
and connected it to the nearby system of Hedion.

Early on, the Amarr drove a sect of the [Sani Sabik](TDJbDXVg3cRp4b6FEkkFS) out from their space. These exiles
traveled to the then-distant constellation of Araz and founded their own
small empire. Unrestrained by Amarr religious restrictions, these
people, who came to be known as the Takmahl, rose to great heights, only
to apparently collapse under the weight of their religion.

The Amarr, meanwhile, slowly began exploring space, eventually coming
into contact with several other surviving civilizations, beginning with
the primitive [Ealur](6TgmS6RKjOYM1Id08VBZzk) in 21432 AD. They
continued to expand over the centuries, encountering and conquering the
[Ni-Kunni](5zoewV2VJJnYgvWj0Khn1K) a thousand years ago, then the
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) in 22480 AD.

In 23508, they finally discovered the [warp drive](7o1BhmhKqoA32WfmkW8Yqt),
enabling them to expand at a much more
rapid space. This enabled them to meet the
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK), [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy), and Jove
within a short space of time in 23180 AD. Though the Amarr judged the
Gallente too powerful to attempt to conquer, they believed the Jove to
be vulnerable. They attacked the Jove in 23216 AD at the [Battle of Vak'Atioth](1Cq1o1feVsJi6HuaVZs1L4) and were soundly
defeated. Shortly after, the [Minmatar rebelled](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N) and cast the Empire out.

The Empire spent the next several decades recovering and have adopted a
more peaceful stance toward the rest of the cluster.

#### Caldari State

The Caldari were first exposed to space by the arrival of the Gallente
on their planet in 22517 AD. Shortly after, the Gallente sent the
Cultural Deliverance Society to the Caldari in 22631 AD, with the aim of advancing the Caldari
technologically. The Caldari exploited this opportunity to the fullest,
expanding out into space under the aegis of the Gallente.

In collaboration with the Gallente, the Caldari developed the first
modern warp drive in the cluster in 22821 AD. This enabled the Caldari
to expand rapidly, outside of the view of the Gallente. The Caldari,
finding the cultural imperialism of the Gallente oppressive, kept their
colonies secret. Their eventual discovery in 23155 AD led to the
outbreak of the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV).

The Caldari were forced to flee [their homeworld](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i)
and founded an independent State in
their own section of space. The two sides fought to a protracted draw,
with each side gaining temporary advantages, only to see them eventually
vanish. The Caldari developed
[fighters](2zJdxBu7hlAbyrhkl5sLou), only for the Gallente to
counter with [drone](3o5QhCbx71nILKNnW9S7v1) technology. The Caldari
then gained the [capsule](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) from the Jove,
while both nations developed the [Titan](XH5ZPvSBGGIStAEWqWHOl). The two
sides fought the second-largest battle in history at the [Battle of Iyen-Oursta](57mej5UVTU6kRfqaSdmRBv), which inflicted heavy
casualties to both.

After nearly a century of conflict, both sides had become exhausted by
the simmering war. They eventually signed a peace treaty in 23248
AD.

#### Gallente Federation

The Gallente managed to discover the Caldari in 22463 AD, but were
unable to contact them, spurring their development of space exploration.
They finally managed to establish contact in 22517 AD. In 22588 AD, they
developed and constructed their first stargate. Unlike the Amarr, they
did not have an intact stargate to study, leading to a different design
than the Amarr.

The Gallente eagerly expanded, driven by curiosity and a thirst for
knowledge. In 22794 AD, they discovered the [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn),
and soon after discovered the [Mannar](4BaMCkOwYaPpd4ZMtEfEY) in 22809 AD.
Much like with the Caldari, the Gallente uplifted these civilizations
with technology, bringing them into the space faring fold.

With help from the Caldari, the Gallente developed the first modern warp
drive in 22821 AD, greatly increasing their ability to explore. With
more and more systems being discovered and colonized, the Gallente
founded the Federation along with the Caldari, Intaki, and Mannar in
23121 AD.

In 23155 AD, the Gallente discovered several secret Caldari colonies.
Because the colonies had not been established according to Federation
law, the Gallente attempted to penalize the Caldari. This eventually
escalated, with the Caldari withdrawing from the Federation. A Caldari
terrorist cell sabotaged a dome of the underwater Gallente city
[Nouvelle Rouvenor](7aF13uW1tkTLI8stM52xK), killing half a
million people.

A fascist government took power in the Federation following the attack,
which began military operations against the Caldari. As the Caldari
evacuated their homeworld, the Federation planned a large assault on the
planet. In order to delay them, a detachment of the Caldari fleet
attacked the [Federation Navy](federation-navy), and engaged
in hit-and-run strikes. When the fleet was too damaged to continue, they
ran one last suicide mission, crashing their carrier into [Gallente Prime](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a), an act which killed two million
people in the city of [Hueromont](1PzpjLA0ZHtQRZu2f8x4gO).

The two sides fought to a protracted draw, with each side gaining
temporary advantages, only to see them eventually vanish. The Caldari
developed fighters, only for the Gallente to counter with drone
technology. The Caldari then gained the capsule from the Jove, while
both nations developed the Titan. The two sides fought the
second-largest battle in history at the Battle of Iyen-Oursta, which
inflicted heavy casualties to both.

After nearly a century of conflict, both sides had become exhausted by
the simmering war. They eventually signed a peace treaty in 23248
AD.

#### Minmatar Republic

The Minmatar discovered space flight in 21413 AD, and spent the next
several centuries exploring and colonizing. Unlike the other races, they
did not construct their own stargates. Instead, they found several
still-working gates and used them to expand across three systems. They
also developed a unique form of faster-than-light travel that was only
later copied by the other races, the acceleration gate.

The Minmatar spent the next several centuries living in peace and
prosperity. Unlike the other nations, they felt no need to expand beyond
their limited reach. This proved to be to their detriment, as the Amarr
discovered them and invaded in 22355 AD. Technologically superior to the
Minmatar, the Amarr were able to cripple the Minmatar defenses and
enslaved millions in an event known as the [Day of Darkness](4pIEpmqcTQ885m2fHwzlR). Over the following
centuries, the majority of the Minmatar would be [enslaved](slavery) by the Empire.

It wasn't until 23216 AD that the Minmatar were able to rebel against
the Amarr and regain their freedom. This required the assistance of the
Gallente and a fortuitous Amarr loss in the Battle of Vak'Atioth.
However, the Minmatar were able to drive the Amarr out of their home
space and take additional territory on top of that, giving them a strong
foundation from which to rebuild their culture.

### CONCORD and Cluster-Wide Peace

In 23230 AD, the five nations came together and founded
[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) as an interstellar peace-keeping
organization. CONCORD brokered peace treaties between the Gallente and
Caldari, putting an end to their nearly-century long war, and the Amarr
and Minmatar, freeing the Republic from the immediate fear of invasion
and reenslavement.

Soon after, in 23236 AD (YC0), CONCORD hosted the Yoiul Conference,
which established [EVE Standard Time](2cJeP2eBHll85PfjQlTtHt).
An unsteady peace embraced the cluster, only being briefly broken by the
rise and destruction of [Sansha's Nation](6dFZYDkE3R4BRF9w21mtjP). This peace continued for over
a century.

### The Empyrean Age

In YC105, a technological breakthrough married
the capsule to cloning technology. This led
to an explosion in [capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) across New Eden,
launching a new era into the cluster. Capsuleers quickly grew in power
and influence and soon became celebrities and idols to the ordinary
people of the cluster. Capsuleers brought untold violence, though the
empires utilized them to their own ends as well.

The capsuleers began to expand and colonize the unclaimed regions of the
cluster, building up their own small empires in the void. These empires
rose and fell with alarming speed, with only a few managing to hold on
to some form of stability and longevity.

The empires created their own violence in
YC110, when the Caldari attacked the Federation
and occupied Caldari Prime, and the Minmatar Elders assaulted the Amarr
Empire in an attempt to free their remaining enslaved brethren. In
response, the empires empowered capsuleers to join militias and fight on
their behalf, under the [CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act](39y03QDhd4N8GXwoV2zSha).

Since then, the entire cluster has been engaged in war.

Life
----

New Eden is home to a great variety of life forms. Humans are the
dominant species, being wider spread than nearly any other multicellular
form of life. They have colonized a large number of
planets, moons,asteroids, and [erected artificial habitations](2qtjPWHmmUS1ochdVGMFx1) in orbit and floating free in
space. Humans have several different races, each with many different
bloodlines. The Minmatar are the most numerous, followed by
near-equal numbers of Amarr and Gallente, with the Caldari somewhat
behind. Trailing distantly are the Jove, whom have not been seen outside
their sealed-off home space for several years, leading to rumors that
they have gone or are on the verge of going extinct.

Non-human species are varied in both form and function. Several species,
such as [wheat](5nxVzXKqvyLGbxwGIW1MVy), are present on several worlds and are
believed to have common non-native origins, while others, such as the
[fedo](1ZTrrDLEL9V2OvHNc8NMkY), are almost certainly entirely
native to their home planets. Other notable life forms include the
[furrier](55Py0v5XOZySNC1oWsEV2O),
[slaver](4nmSv26geCZDYdQ8E5cVh9), and [hanging long-limb](2tFXLpKbQFayGBKL7pQiVd). Many of these species
have spread from their native habitats thanks to human intervention.
Similarly, humans have been responsible for mass extinctions of entire
worlds through accident or intention, by the introduction of foreign
pathogens or through terraforming efforts.
