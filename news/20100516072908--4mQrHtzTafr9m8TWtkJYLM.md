 **YWS0-Z, Providence** \- On 112.04.29, Chipmo of The Star Fraction announced on GALNET the foundation of his Civil Court of New Providence [CCCNP].[![Chipmo, Founder Of The Civil Court Of New Providence](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3884/chipmothumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3884/chipmo.png)  
  
Chipmo's court will offer capsuleers a way to resolve disputes without resorting to violence. Initially based in Providence, it may eventually be extended to all of New Eden's pilots.  
  
The court will operate with Chipmo as a monocratic justice. Clients will be allowed to hire attorneys and detectives to present their facts.  
  
Doubts on the Court's method of operation have already been raised: "I can understand the hassle of organising an impartial jury to assist... [however], I do think to be completely 'fair' a monocratic court is not the way forward," said Grr, diplomat for Curatores Veritatis Alliance.  
  
A case has already been filed with the Court and there has been some interest in Chipmo adjudicating another two disputes.
