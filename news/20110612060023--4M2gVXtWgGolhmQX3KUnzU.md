The first rounds of the Group Stages are complete as we continue to move towards the Finals scheduled for next weekend.  
  
With twice the ships and twice the points, field choices have been more varied as teams jostle for a position in the Finals.  
  
Returning champions Pandemic Legion debuted today in Alliance Tournament IX and performed as anticipated, wrecking Ushra'Khan for the first flawless victory of the day.  
  
Cumulative statistics still show the Tengu as the #1 choice of ship with 88 fielded to date. Cyclone (80), Scimitar (69), Sabre (67) and Sleipnir (57) continue to dominate the Top 5 as well.  
  
Match reports and statistics are available on the Interstellar Correspondents' website.
