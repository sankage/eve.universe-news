**Jetek** is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) crewmember who served on board
[Empress](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) [Jamyl I's](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L)
ship. He was selected for his unquestioning loyalty to the Empire, after
having passed numerous psych evaluations and other tests.

Conversation with the Empress
-----------------------------

While walking through the ship one evening to look out a window in a
quiet, off-the-path room, he encountered the Empress herself. Though he
was initially taken aback, she coaxed him into a conversation - though
it was rather more of a monologue - on the subject of belief,
forgiveness and respect, during which she revealed to him the fate of
[Kerrigan Orsha](78tqIDc7xyvv1uXXLgZx9N). Throughout the conversation
Jetek remained reserved and awed, and when Jamyl was finished talking,
and told him he would never speak of their talk to anyone else, he
agreed completely.
