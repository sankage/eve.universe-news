**Szekel** was a researcher at [Outpost 4972](7lJLYLN8srQsuRHZJsCfVR),
hired after his vetting by [Kartanen Sedia](5bDYodgIEgZ86om2ukOxB4)
turned up a clean background. [Jania Bedtot](56BeuvPy8Z92016R3TH5ER)
taught him how to use all the equipment at the outpost.

After an asteroid containing unusual [Archaea](3CFfeyl7A1XFocp78R0x9L) landed on the planet, he
and Jania began extensive research on it. He eventually stole the data
and escapes with it, causing an investigation that eventually led to the
torture of the remaining outpost crew.
