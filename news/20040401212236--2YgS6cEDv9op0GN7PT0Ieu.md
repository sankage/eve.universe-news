This morning President Souro Foiritan of the Gallente Federation, in closed session with the Federal Security Council, ordered a special investigative task force assembled. The task force, which will reportedly consist of the Federation’s top law enforcement and intelligence agents, has been given the assigment of tracking down and bringing to justice the people behind the UDI (United Against Decadence and Impurity), the mysterious splinter faction which has claimed responsibility for the attack committed on the Rent-A-Dream Pleasure Gardens complex in Elarel yesterday evening.   
  
President Foiritan had intended to show up at the festivities as a surprise guest, but his escorts warped in to find only a gigantic cloud of fallout where the station had been. At an impromptu press conference in the minutes following his arrival, the obviously shaken president stated that the perpetrators of this heinous act would be brought to justice, taking the time to thank the pilots assembled in the system for their valiant struggle in fending off the tide of aggressors.  
  
The tragedy yesterday claimed the lives of over six hundred Gallente entertainment industry giants, among them actors, directors, producers, cinematographers and agents. Writes cultural commentator Belle-Marie Jincroix in today’s _Federation Tribune_ : “The effects of yesterday’s horrific massacre will make ripples in the entertainment industry unlike anything we’ve ever seen. Sure, most of these people have clones, but as we’ve seen time and time again people never turn out _exactly_ the same as before, and the slight differences a clone transplant can effect have time and time again proven enough to break a movie star’s mojo. It will be interesting to see how the Gallente entertainment industry recovers from this massive blow.”
