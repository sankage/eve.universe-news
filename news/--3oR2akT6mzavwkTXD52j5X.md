# St. Tetrimon
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/st-tetrimon

St. Tetrimon (born Inire Ardishapur in 21346 AD, died 21460 AD) was
an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) martyr and the namesake of the [Order of St. Tetrimon](4Z9IYnlIENaSBblXROhEfY). The grandson of
[Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) [Zaragram II](1DsGoYgw9GBQN8lqX77VlE), the Mad Emperor, Inire assassinated his own
grandfather after Zaragram II's religious heresy grew too much to bear.
He famously shouted the words "a manu dei e tet rimon" before striking,
from which he received his epithet.

Early Life
----------

Inire Ardishapur was born to the [Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) in 21346 AD, the grandson of the
family leader, Zaragram Ardishapur. Zaragram had only a single child, a
daughter who had suffered through several miscarriages prior to
successfully delivering Inire. Healthy and full of life, Inire was a
blessing to the family and seen as a good omen.

Indeed, several months after his birth, the Amarr Emperor died. Zaragram
held enormous sway over the [Council of Apostles]council-of-apostles), as the Ardishapur Family was
never more powerful than it was in those days. He easily became the new
Emperor and was enthroned later that year as Zaragram II. Zaragram named
a nephew as the new Ardishapur heir, but held a special regard for
Inire, whom he considered to be a good luck charm. He attempted to have
the child brought to the Imperial Palace, where he could learn at his
side.

His mother refused, however, believing a strictly religious upbringing
would serve the child best. As soon as he was old enough, she sent Inire
to study with the [Speakers of Truth](3vA8Xh4A10DiybH2UTOEUO).

Years of Study
--------------

Inire proved to be a highly pious and devout student. His teachers
marveled at his ability to understand the finer points of
[Scripture](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp). Even as a teenager, he made
insightful commentary on a number of pieces of Scripture, often
surprising even the Speakers with his wisdom. Many thought he would one
day become a priest, and many pushed for him to join with the Speakers
once he became of age.

Inire, however, knew his duty was to his family above all else. As the
grandson of the Emperor, he would be expected to lead the next
generation of Ardishapurs to greatness. He remained with the Speakers
for a number of years, however, even after he had finished his
education, in an effort to learn the finer points of Scripture. He often
professed a desire to memorize the Scriptures in their entirety, though
that was known to be virtually impossible, even discounting such
difficulties as the massive [Book of Records](5cxn8rCjeyzZ2Q4jZVH3zf).

In 21403 AD, Inire's mother passed away from complications with another
childbirth. At this point, Inire knew his family needed him, so he left
the Speakers to resume his life among the Amarr royalty.

Return
------

Inire returned to his family and took over his mother's title and duties
as a [Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v). However, he found the world quite
different than the one he had left. The Speakers had shielded him from
the goings on of the Empire while he studied with them, so he was
completely shocked by the changes Zaragram II had implemented.

Before he could truly investigate what had happened, however, he had to
deal with his own estate. As he had spent decades away, he had little
knowledge of his duties as a Holder. He spent many years learning from
family advisors, earning their loyalty and respect. Once he had
accomplished this, he spent several further years traveling across his
domains, speaking with commoners and Holders alike, hearing their
thoughts and learning their concerns.

He was shocked to discover many of them speaking of his grandfather
almost as if he were God. Many prayed directly to Zaragram for
forgiveness and favor and worshiped him above all else. Believing this
to be some sort of mistake, Inire traveled to the Imperial City of
[Dam-Torsad](UI6KVmdCZ0H42EvHijFVZ) to see the truth for himself.

What he found shocked him. Zaragram II was nothing like the doting
grandfather he remembered. Inire confronted Zaragram, but was harshly
rebuked by his grandfather and ejected from the palace.

Plot
----

Inire knew that his grandfather's corruption of the Amarr religion could
not be allowed to continue. However, Zaragram had been thorough in his
usurpation of the Scriptures, and the people of the Empire were firmly
in his side. Additionally, much of his own family approved of Zaragram's
actions, as it promised to keep them the dominant force in the Empire
for generations to come.

Though he discovered sympathetic voices among the Council of Apostles,
none were willing to stand against the Emperor. Inire resolved that he
must act on his own, else see the Empire lose its soul forever.

Inire spent the next several years slowly ingratiating himself back into
the good graces of his grandfather. Through subtle flattery, insightful
words, and favorable actions, he painted a picture of himself as a man
who had fully embraced Zaragram. On more than one occasion, he turned
over those who had spoken ill of the Emperor to the inquisitors, often
betraying friends in the process.

Finally, as Zaragram was ready to journey to his [City of God](6bnrd04bo5T04nAelip7cS), Inire's work paid off. He was one of the
few invited to join Zaragram at the City's opening in 21460 AD.

Assassination
-------------

Inire traveled to the City of God ahead of his grandfather and entered
the Imperial Palace. He secreted a dagger inside his robe and prostrated
himself upon the floor of the throne room. When the Emperor and his
guards entered the room, they saw Inire kneeling, his head down.
Zaragram approached his grandson and asked why he was there.

Inire said nothing. He sprang to his feet and drew the dagger. With one
swift motion, he slashed Zaragram's throat. As Zaragram's horrified
guards fell on Inire, he raised his hand and called out "a manu dei e
tet rimon", which meant "I am the devoted hand of the divine God" in an
ancient Amarr tongue.

Legacy
------

The Council of Apostles quickly went about reversing Zaragram II's
edicts and erasing his name from the history. His name was struck from
the Book of Records and all paintings, statues, and other idols were
eradicated.

Reversing his changes to Scripture were much more difficult. Zaragram
had changed many parts of it and had those that contradicted his words
destroyed. Much of the Empire's Scripture was feared gone forever. In an
effort to recover what had been lost, the Council formed a new religious
order dedicated to restoring the Scriptures to their old form. This
order was composed of the greatest scholars in the Empire and they
traveled to remote monasteries, seeking out fragments of Scripture that
had not been altered by Zaragram II.

Inire was beatified by the Council for his actions. However, in an
effort to contain the truth, that an Emperor had descended into heresy
and been slain by his own grandson, they could not call him by name lest
undesired connections be made. Instead, he was named St. Tetrimon, after
his final triumphant words. The religious order founded to restore the
Scriptures were named in his honor.
