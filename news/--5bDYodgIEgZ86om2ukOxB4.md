# Kartanen Sedia
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/kartanen-sedia

**Kartanen Sedia** was an outpost overseer. He was born on an [asteroid colony](6NQhah6uyVb1Bzg0ifUe5N) and spent a good part of his life
working on similar places. He eventually grew to dislike living in space
and transferred to terrestrial colonies. He maintained exemplary
security during his thirty years of services and had a near-perfect
record, until it suffered a major blemish during his time as the
overseer of [Outpost 3478](4vqxY65eebQdhV55hWSbjE), out near Stain.

Incident at Outpost 3478
------------------------

[Sansha's Nation](6dFZYDkE3R4BRF9w21mtjP) attacked the outpost and
abducted the majority of the crew. Though Sedia was investigated and
cleared of wrongdoing, his career was ruined by the incident and he was
never able to rise above his lower management position.

Theft at Outpost 4972
---------------------

He was eventually hired on as the overseer of [Outpost 4972](7lJLYLN8srQsuRHZJsCfVR), where for three years they extracted
minerals that were used in the capsuleer industry. The outpost also had
a staff of research scientists who studied the planet's life.

Sedia was responsible for hiring [Szekel](2KLlyAO4njOMOllcdmqgtv), a
scientist who later stole valuable research. After the theft, Sedia was
investigated and interrogated by corporate police. Though he attempted
to cooperate, the police eventually resorted to torture. Sedia attempted
to pin responsibility on [Rakan Dep](1mJatucCrGapiHxzZQna6Y), a security
officer. Following further torture, he confessed to taking a share of
the money Szekel had offered for complicity in the theft, then admitted
to taking all of the money before returning to claiming he had accepted
only a share. The police seemed unable to find further evidence of this,
however.

During the torture - when the torture device was momentarily turned off - Sedia berated his torturers, claiming he would report them. He was
either killed or viciously injured as a result, as one of the
scientists, [Jania Bedtot](56BeuvPy8Z92016R3TH5ER), expressed horror at
what had happened to him.
