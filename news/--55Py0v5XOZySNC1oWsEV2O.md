# Furriers
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/furriers

**Furriers** are small furry animals that make twittering sounds and are commonly kept as pets by higher-class [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo). A furrier was notoriously the catalyst of what became the [Ardishapur Decree](6hU25lQLApAKe2PoFmqQpB).

Furriers tend to have a rounded, stub of a tail and their four limbs are clawed in an almost bird-like fashion. The forelimbs are short and can be used for grasping. Furriers have a plated face with a beak and large black eyes. A crest grows from the rear of the head. They are sometimes used, in complete disregard of good morals and nature's inherent beauty, to demonstrate torture and execution devices.
