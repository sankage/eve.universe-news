**Joroutte Duvolle** is the CEO of [Duvolle Laboratories](1khBWLK52GfHvRQ1xUrOPb). Jourotte is
well-respected among her workforce, in good part due to her people
skills, her interest in the operation of every level of Duvolle's
operation, and her trust in her subordinates to do their jobs properly
without undue intervention.

She displayed those skills, along with remarkable patience, during the
transition from Tech I to Tech II
blueprints at her corporation, a time
when she had to deal with workers like [Robert](6fm2V9z0HrpBGUVTPQlswV).
