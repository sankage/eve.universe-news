Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/amarr-prime

**Amarr Prime** is the name of the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) homeworld.
It was originally known as Athra before it was conquered by
the people of the original Amarr continent, who lent the planet its
present name. It is also the ancestral home of the
[Udorians](723tMHRDvyldo15RMLMuqh) and the [Khanid](1IRIdXfOZrfl5BuFuabOh6).

It is the third planet in the Amarr system in the Domain region, and is
the capital of the Amarr Empire.

Moons
-----

Amarr Prime has two moons, though they are not large enough to cause
solar eclipses.

Settlements
-----------

[Dam-Torsad](UI6KVmdCZ0H42EvHijFVZ), the planet's capital, is the
largest city on the planet, sprawling for endless miles around. The
[True Amarr](2DkiJVfiL1RYP5y7AJGSNN) originated on the
[island](4wZzhhUMIfR4ziHGaMOiLJ) bearing the same name. The planet also
holds several known or even famous sites, such as the [Tal-Romon Cathedral](sQa3CgriPhcdRyu5wArOb), [Garden of Contemplation](4gFdMXv7phxEup4bRflTBN), and [Court Chamberlain's antechamber](3W4krTLGOQqhYqlc2qAG1N).
