The **Vampire** was a prototype [combat drone](5TesdXq5to62CrbIBuPXxS) developed by an unnamed company or
group. It was legendary for its cost - rumored to cost as much as a
fully fitted [cruiser](3wE5sDRggwgYjiExdCRyL0). It was also said to be
running an experimental wetware [AI](67UaJpJzvXXlhQc8a0GnWR) brain. The prototype
of the drone was destroyed in an engagement with three
[Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) pirates as it was being moved by the
pilot [Uragan Zelp](1EGr4d83ZVFXWR1jPsxaxw). The drone itself had a red
carapace and arachnid eyes.
