The star system **Pator** is the home system of the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) people.

Historical Background
---------------------

Originally cataloged as CMS-17 when it was discovered in 8017 AD,
the system was soon renamed Pator, and quickly colonized. The fourth
planet in particular, [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6), was well suited to
colonization and gave birth to the Minmatar civilization.

Of the nine planets, six of them are host to some form of life. At the
height of the first Minmatar space age, these six planets had
settlements, either on, or below the surface, or in orbit.

Pator has been particularly hard used by human habitation, and there is
speculation that some of its moons may have been harvested well before
the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) occupation that saw an increase in the
plunder of natural resources.

Today
-----

Pator is the seat of government for the Minmatar Republic, and is
undergoing the same rapid changes seen elsewhere in Minmatar space.
There is unprecedented growth in the tourism, heritage, culture, and
governance fields, though other industries have suffered major
disruptions. The mining industry alone is figured to have lost millions
in held-up mining rights, as the government tries to process tribal land
claims.

Celestials

### Sun

Pator is a bright orange K5 star just under 10 billion years old. It has
a radius of 125,400 km, and a temperature near 4500 Kelvin. This star is
very stable and emits very few solar flares.

### Inner Planets

#### Pator I

This lava planet, also known as Istinn, has an orbit radius of 0.42 AU
and an orbit period of 85.1 days. It is a source of base metals, heavy
metals, and magma, among other materials. It has no moons and no
asteroid belts.

#### Pator II

Also named Belogor, this planet is classified as barren, though it does
host some very simple forms of life. It has a very low surface pressure,
and an orbit period of 216.2 days. Belogor was the second planet to be
colonized by the Minmatar. A small mining colony was established here
that ran until it was completely depopulated on the [Day of Darkness](4pIEpmqcTQ885m2fHwzlR).

#### Pator III

Pator III, also known as Huggar, was the first planet settled by the
Minmatar during their first, brief space age. Although there is some
indication that this planet was colonized prior to the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o)
collapse, whatever civilization had been here
died out well before the arrival of the Minmatar in 21424 AD. This
temperate planet, with an average annual surface temperature of 307.66
Kelvin, or 34.51 Celsius, plays host to both simple and complex forms of
life, and was the logical choice for the first Minmatar colonization
efforts. The colony established here flourished until contact with the
Amarr. Although it wasn't completely depopulated during the Day of
Darkness, more than half its population was taken. With the trade routes
to Matar cut off, the colonies here languished in a primitive state, and
were easy pickings for future Amarr slave raids.

The planet has two moons, and is home to a
[Republic Security Services](5Iqs1mpJ1075p4JNwbuinu) Assembly Plant.

#### Pator IV

Sometimes referred to as Old Mother, Pator IV is more commonly known
as Matar. This temperate planet plays host to numerous forms of life,
and has one moon and one asteroid belt. Most of its land mass is
concentrated on one side of the planet, giving it one of the largest
oceans in the cluster, often referred to as the Great Wet Desert.

Little is known of the pre-collapse society that developed here.
However, after the EVE Gate collapse, four distinct civilizations
developed. Despite some early warfare among these civilizations, they
eventually merged to become recognizable as the foundation of the
Minmatar people.

#### Pator V

This storm planet, also named Vakir, is home to a [Republic Fleet](2c4ZwKPnuW6mYkLJ2dGh94)
Logistic Support station. It has one
asteroid belt, and one moon, that also plays host to a [Quafe Company](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6)
Factory. Despite its rather mild
temperatures, the storms have ensured that no life of any kind has
developed on this planet, though its resources and proximity to Matar
have kept its space lanes busy.

#### Pator VI

As with the other barren planets in this system, Pator VI (also known as
Varkal), is host to some simple forms of life. There remains some liquid
trapped below the surface, and this, combined with a myriad of metals,
has seen colonies established here, though not large enough to warrant a
station in orbit. The first colony established here was completely
depopulated on the Day of Darkness.

There is a single asteroid belt about 54 km wide that orbits fairly
close to the planet at just a little over 300 million km.

#### Pator VII

With an average surface temperature of 305.88 K(or 32.73 Celsius), Pator
VII, also known as Kulheim, was the second planet settled by the
Minmatar. Although this barren planet, at a distance of 5.91 AU, is home
to some forms of simple life, the colonies here never really flourished,
and were completely depopulated by the Amarr slave ships on the day of
first contact.

There is a Republic Security Services Assembly Plant, and asteroid belt
orbiting the planet itself. It's one moon is also home to a Republic
Fleet Testing Facility.

#### Pator VIII

Also known as Orinn, this storm planet is host to numerous raw
materials. Though the Minmatar originally tried to establish a mining
colony here, the storms proved too much for continual habitation of any
kind, and colonization attempts had been abandoned well before first
contact with the Amarr. Its single moon has an orbit period of 9.7 days.

#### Pator IX

This oceanic planet, also named Syld, plays host to numerous forms of
life. Despite it being the last of the five planets colonized by the
Minmatar prior to the arrival of the Amarr, it quickly grew to become
the third largest settlement in Pator. It has a very high surface
temperature of 354.10 K, or 80.95 Celsius, though much of the heat comes
from the core of the planet itself. Although originally host mainly to
food production colonies, Syld has become a premier vacation destination
within the Republic, with many companies operating year-round, floating
resorts.
