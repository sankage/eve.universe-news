SYSTEM M-MD3B - In the frantic search for the Thukker caravan last known in SL-YBS system, the Trust Partners corporation has stepped in to act as the co-ordinating agency among the caravans and any Minmatar Republic craft present in Great Wildlands. A volume of space centered on the missing caravan's last checkpoint is being quartered by ships from many different caravans and numerous Republic trade convoys.   
  
Several squadrons of Republic Fleet ships have been ordered to co-operate with the search in any way possible by Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor. It is believed several more squadrons are making their way to Great Wildlands to offer further assistance.
