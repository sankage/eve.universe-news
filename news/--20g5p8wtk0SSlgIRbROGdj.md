**Ceul Darieux** was the founder of drone manufacturing powerhouse
[CreoDron](3lCriaLYr0Nrmj9pkru5Z3) he was the sole survivor of an ill-fated
mission to construct a [stargate](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) in the system
then known as Ouperia. Spending over 50 years in deep space after an
asteroid damaged his ship, Darieux's inventions during that time not
only helped him return home - but also provided unsurpassed advances in
[drone](3o5QhCbx71nILKNnW9S7v1) and robotics technologies.

Dying only a few years after his unexpected return, Darieux is
memorialized by the common name for the Ouperia system- Old Man Star.
