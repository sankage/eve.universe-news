# Quantum Nanomorphic Alloy
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/quantum-nanomorphic-alloy

**Quantum nanomorphic alloy** is a ternary alloy composed of germanium,
palladium, and a reactive nanotech-based fusing component of
[Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) origin. This material is used primarily as the
outer shell casing of a pod [capsule](capsule-lore). The
nano-material is composed of molecules whose composite atoms are capable
of altering quantum states based on environmental stimuli to accommodate
gravitonic induction and convergence.
