In an earlier news report, we stated that a pilot known as "Budy" claimed to be hold Admiral Trevize's prized medal. this information turned out to be false, as you can read [in this open GalNet channel](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=162913&page=3)   
  
Although it is unknown who holds the medal at this time, has been studied by Admiral Trevize. It shows his prized slaver dogs were manipulated by an as-yet unidentified individual. Again, we will have more inormation when it becomes available.
