**Asadir** is a [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) mercenary. He is noted to be a tech head and appears to be the primary engineer and pilot of the merc team. When his team was contracted to discover the location of [Anvent Eturrer](4ft267N4XjELE5by1uHCt5), Asadir wired an EMP device to deactivate [Skids's](51Xxa9YLYD6k1cW0Z3EETN) Quickdraw implant and activate her [Dead man's switch](3Z5w49e94cXP0OFn0iBBQk).

Asadir seems to enjoy needling [Amarrian](7BDNWe469BCdW0xdEmkWr7) team member [Kardeth](1eDxAF2ipYJL5vHQIrWv4z).
