# Yonis Ardishapur
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/yonis-ardishapur

The Royal Heir **Yonis Ardishapur** was the head of the [Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO), one of the [Five Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) to the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) Throne, and the leader of the [Ammatar Mandate](4BV4ldw5RdVB4FxKctn4J6). He was a staunch conservative and clashed behind the scenes with [Empress](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ), [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L), over her policies. Thanks to his savvy mind, personal charm, and political sharpness, he carved out one of the most powerful fiefdoms in the Empire.

Early Life
----------

Yonis was born in 23212 AD to [Idonis Ardishapur](2ZNvkPaPzpj4IaVpL2vWK3). As part of the [Ardishapur Decree](6hU25lQLApAKe2PoFmqQpB), his right hand was amputated and replaced with a silver cybernetic
[prosthetic](5qIWvxsa4ayo3MzGijHspk).

As the first son of the powerful heir, Yonis was groomed to take over
for his father. Since Emperor [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV)
was entering his third century of rule, it was anticipated that this day
would arrive in the next few years. As such, the young lord was put
under enormous pressure, spending the majority of his time in studies
both religious and worldly. Despite the demands on him, Yonis proved a
bright, energetic, engaging student, readily soaking up knowledge and
drawing great acclaim from his father's [Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v).

By his thirtieth birthday, Yonis was well prepared to step into his
father's shoes. However, Emperor Heideran continued to rule in frail,
but unchanging, health. This created tension within the Ardishapur
Family, as Yonis had been molded to be ambitious and clever in dealings.
Rumors began to circulate that the younger Ardishapur was growing
dissatisfied with remaining in the shadow of his father.

In what proved to be one of the first of many diplomatically savvy moves
by Yonis, he announced his intentions to study with the [Speakers of Truth](3vA8Xh4A10DiybH2UTOEUO). By making such a move, Yonis
removed himself as an immediate challenger to his father's power.
Following a decade of study with the Speakers, Yonis then reemerged with
his father's blessings and took on a more active role in the Family's
affairs. He frequently stood in for his father during court and made
judgments on his behalf that were well regarded among his Holders. He
also acted as a diplomat and negotiator, repeatedly proving his cunning.

It was during these years that Yonis began his fascination with
collecting religious artifacts. His collection began small, but rapidly
swelled, as he used his influence and familial wealth to gather some of
the oldest and most prized relics. He also sponsored many archeological
explorations across the cluster, many of which uncovered treasure troves
of religious items. Some of these he donated to the
[Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) and museums throughout the Empire,
but opinion holds he kept the choicest pieces for himself. Many of his
artifacts are rumored to date back to the collapse of the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o).

Royal Heir \- Early Years
-------------------------

In [YC105](7fPQjSvh0UicNGNdh3nVkd), [Doriam Kor-Azor](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT) won the
[Amarr Championships](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx) and was crowned the Emperor
of the Amarr Empire. As is tradition, Idonis then committed the ritual
suicide of [Shathol'Syn](7uCmeRGL3bgVWlEWQ9TZQb). Yonis immediately
stepped in and consolidated his power in his holdings, with his Holders
universally pledging their dedication to him in a traditional loyalty
ceremony. Yonis refused any gifts given to him to celebrate his
ascension, preferring to earn such platitudes by his own merits rather
than the death of his father.

Early in his reign, Ardishapur proved willing to step into controversy
in order to maintain the religious path of the Empire. Following the
[Tal-Romon cathedral](sQa3CgriPhcdRyu5wArOb) incident caused by
[Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV), Yonis publicly voiced
his displeasure with his fellow heir and demanded an investigation by
Doriam II. He was further outraged when the holy site was purchased
by the [Tash-Murkon Family](4t1KEOTA8LvYIHDcOtIPAb), who planned
to turn it into a tourist attraction.  He and [Uriam Kador](7LJKelrqDXAAUYi6o48Uno) met privately to discuss the matter,
forming the beginning of a steady alliance between the two houses.

It seemed that Yonis received his way when Doriam II seized control of
the cathedral and made it his personal property. However, there were
whispers that such drastic intervention directly against one of the
Heirs had caused Yonis worry. In recognition of Doriam's newly
extended power, Yonis avoided conflict with his fellow heirs for some
time after.

In the same year, he had his family express displeasure at a Quafe Ultra
ad that he felt blasphemously portrayed the cathedral at
[Dam-Torsad](UI6KVmdCZ0H42EvHijFVZ).

When Doriam II was assassinated in YC107, Yonis pledged much of the
Family's manpower to discovering the killer. However, his efforts were
rebuked by [Chamberlain](4cstqCKrXLAu5XDiqztSe6)
[Karsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL) and [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt),
who preferred to conduct their own investigation without outside
intervention.

Yonis privately pushed for another Amarr Championships to be held
without delay. However, he found reluctance from his fellow Heirs, who
had all just recently come into power. Aritcio Kor-Azor and Catiz
Tash-Murkon were especially against it, and Uriam Kador proved
noncommittal on the subject. Additionally,
[House Sarum](4EZ4a3Mw8QXHmisAA4Ff6L) had yet to name an Heir, leaving a
power vacuum that needed to be filled before a new Emperor could be
named. Chamberlain Karsoth also pushed against the crowning of an
Emperor soon after the death of Doriam II, stating that the Empire could
not stand having an Emperor while the killer of the previous one
remained at large.

The stonewalling from his fellow Heirs embittered Yonis, who had no
choice but to accede to their wishes. This strained his relationship
with Uriam Kador, whom Yonis began to view as weak-willed and incapable
of making decisions on his own.

In the following years, Yonis had little choice but to attend to his own
domains, ensuring their stability and prosperity while the rest of the
Empire struggled leaderless.

Return of Jamyl Sarum
---------------------

By the middle of [YC109](7y1pTkEqQKTYMZRyVLLN8w), the lack of an Emperor
had ignited passions across the Empire.
[Capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) loyalist alliances, along with masses
of commoners, protested directly to Chamberlain Karsoth about the
constant delaying in the proceedings. Yonis Ardishapur spoke briefly to
the Amarr News Service about the
matter, stating that he was in favor of Championship trials as long as
they remained racially pure; he did not want foreigners to decide the
fate of the Empire.

During the Elder Invasion in [YC110](4s7KrRaqQANTatQhzlSaRi), Ardishapur
space was mostly spared. While the Kador and Kor-Azor regions were
suffering heavy losses, Ardishapur's defense fleets moved quickly into
position to drive off invaders. In the end, the Elder Fleet never
reached Ardishapur's holdings, as they were routed in [Sarum Prime](uO7T7UMc6L0S8OUcHJJqP) by the return of Jamyl Sarum.

Yonis joined his fellow Heirs in Dam-Torsad to discuss the mysterious
return of Jamyl from the dead. Yonis believed Jamyl to be a heretic had
who violated the tenets of the Shathol'Syn and [Sacred Flesh](3k3re1JeaMxvvTRz3qARFv) by cloning herself. However, the other
Heirs stood in opposition to him, with Uriam Kador displaying more
indecision by allowing himself to be swayed by Catiz and Aritcio.
Outnumbered three-to-one, and knowing that the Empire would hail Jamyl
as a savior, Yonis gave in with disgust and chose to bide his time until
he could act against this heresy.

Despite his objections, Yonis was chosen to release word that the Heirs
had chosen Jamyl to accept the throne. As the most devout of the
Heirs, it was believed his voice would carry the most weight with any
who would object. Yonis, however, viewed the matter privately as a
massive insult.

After the Theology Council affirmed the Heirs' desires, Yonis departed
hastily without speaking. A spokesman gave a brief statement on his
behalf which did little to praise the new Empress.

Following Empress Jamyl I's coronation, she vowed to "return what others
give to the Empire". In response, Yonis announced a massive public
works campaign within his domains. He leveraged a portion of his
family's wealth to construct hundreds of schools, cathedrals, and
monuments. In announcing the project, he made pointed reference to
religious laws, which some viewed as a veiled attack on Jamyl's
legitimacy.

Ruler of the Ammatar Mandate
----------------------------

### Unexpected vassalage

In a surprising move, Jamyl I placed the Ammatar Mandate under the
vassalage of the Ardishapur Family, essentially integrating the
quasi-independent state into the Empire. Publicly, the move was
made in response to Ardishapur's Public Works program, as the Empress
felt Yonis would be the most capable of rebuilding the shattered
Mandate.

Privately, it was rumored that the Empress was placing an albatross
around Ardishapur's neck. Ardishapur's public statements, while never
openly criticizing the Empress, were frequently found to have subtext
challenging her rule. The Empress likely believed that Ardishapur would
flounder in the Mandate: Either his religious conservatism would lead to
clashes with the Ammatar people, or he would neglect the territory, thus
weakening his own stance within the Empire. Seditious elements within
the Mandate shared these beliefs.

In the beginning, it seemed their expectations would be fulfilled, as
Yonis began moving lesser Holders from his traditional domains and
putting them in vacant leadership positions in the Mandate. Yonis
himself disabused notions that he was going to take the title of
Governor, saying he was searching for the proper candidate.

### Update of the Ammatar Fleet

He followed this by arresting Admiral Einkur Aro, the head of the
[Ammatar Fleet](3as0Qu7kajUNvkjJdBSwF1), on charges of treason,
dereliction of duty, and failure to prevent mutiny - actions that spread
fear he would begin a purge of the Fleet's leadership. To the shock
of many, the Admiral pled guilty to the charges. He was sentenced to
death, while his family was to be enslaved for his crimes.

Yonis continued his consolidation of power by appointing the head of his
security forces, Admiral Hastar Jibril, as the new head of the Ammatar
Fleet. The portion of the heir's personal fleet under Jibril's command
was likewise integrated into the Fleet's forces, in order to bolster the
decimated forces of the Mandate.  Some considered this a savvy move
on Yonis's part, as it placed the Mandate Fleet's loyalty firmly in his
hand, which protected him from the Empress stripping his fleet as she
did with the Kador Family's. However, the tides of concern began to turn
in Yonis's favor when Admiral Jibril announced a swath of promotions
through the Mandate Fleet. The vast majority of the promotions were
given to veterans of [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) birth, particularly
those who showed loyalty and bravery during the Elder Invasion.

### Public works program

This was followed by Ardishapur announcing a repeat of his public works
program within the Mandate. Trillions of ISK were poured into the
Mandate to build schools, hospitals, cathedrals, and repairing
infrastructure damaged during the Elder Invasion. The package created
millions of jobs, as slave labor was unable to meet demands, and was
believed to be one of the largest initiatives of such type in Empire
history. The move restored the economy and won him wide acclaim in
the Mandate, as people found their lives quickly improved
beyond what they'd had even before the Elder Invasion.

Following the reconstruction of the Mandate's infrastructure, the focus
was placed on building hospitals and religious buildings in the "Body
and Soul" program. Yonis ordered the naming of a major seminary after
the martyr [Abel Jarek](5HDj1enu8OW6rTNg6d9dR8), which was viewed as a
message that Minmatar converts to the Amarr religion would not be
forgotten.

The rebuilding of shipyards was next on the agenda. Five shipyards on
Sasta were reopened and began producing vessels for the Mandate Fleet,
including a new series of "Yonis Variant" Abaddons intended for prestige
patrol duty. The food production of the Mandate was restored
to pre-war levels shortly after.

The reconstruction of the Mandate was considered completed when Yonis
appointed an ethnic Ammatar, Ekroz Salaf, as the new Mandate Governor.
This move allayed many concerns that the Ammatar would remain in
subservient positions in the Mandate under Yonis's rule. Salaf's
appointment helps raised morale throughout the Mandate.

Yonis gained additional acclaim when he authorized the introduction of
several penal regiments for Ammatar criminals and officers dishonored
during the Elder Invasion. As an alternative to slavery, these regiments
allowed those serving a method of absolving their crimes.

The impact of Yonis on the Mandate went beyond rebuilding, as his
influence caused the orthodox Amarr faith to supplant the Ammatar
Church.

Interaction with the 24th Imperial Crusade
------------------------------------------

An archeological team sponsored by Ardishapur escaped from a contested
area between the Amarr Empire and [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp).
Their dig had discovered several
significant relics, the majority of which belonged to St. Anam and
had been though long lost. The Saint notably founded a groundwork of
religious ethics.

As a result of these findings, the final resting place of St. Aman was
uncovered. However, the area was in Kourmonen, which at the time was
occupied by the [Tribal Liberation Force](11ibKkJrDSo9khSLpweUnq). In response, Yonis took the
unusual step of commanding the [24th Imperial Crusade](3QsjSgklI3Le0W5KfKatW9) to retake the system.
The command was a success and the Crusade reclaimed the
[Bleak Lands](1thJ31aFnpCVAbE0rkntPP) the next month. The bones of St.
Aman were recovered and moved to Dakba, where Yonis made a public
appearance and personally escorted them to their temporary resting
place. He praised the capsuleers who aided in their retrieval and
promised to reward them. In recognition, he awarded medals to
pilots who fought with "particular vigor" in the engagements.

Yonis pledged significant funds to help rebuild war-torn Ezzara, which
had changed hands between the Tribal Liberation Force and 24th Crusade
numerous times since war broke out.

Strained Relations with the Tash-Murkon
---------------------------------------

Ardishapur suffered some small embarrassment when a
[Khanid](khanid-kingdom) convoy en route to one of his
stations was ambushed by Minmatar terrorists and had to be rescued by
nearby Tash-Murkon forces. He was forced to offer his personal
thanks to the Tash-Murkon Family, while also insinuating that the
presence of Tash-Murkon vessels near his space had caused the incident
to begin with.

Yonis came under some criticism when he appointed an ultra-conservative
theologian to the post of chancellor at one of his newly-opening
schools. The chancellor, Derek Tanar, believed that only True Amarrians
were deserving of leadership in the Empire and that all other bloodlines
should remain subservient. He had particularly gathered ire for
suggesting the Tash-Murkon Family be expunged from their Royal seat.
Yonis distanced himself from Tanar's more controversial views, while
declaring him an exemplary choice for administering the school.
Some viewed this as a veiled attack on the Tash-Murkon Family by
Ardishapur in response to the embarrassment he suffered at the hands of
the Tash-Murkon earlier in the year.

As Ardishapur spread his influence in the Mandate, one Tash-Murkon
Holder gave up his holdings and declared his intent to move to the
Ammatar Mandate. The holder viewed the more conservative and faith-based
leanings being promoted by Ardishapur superior to the liberalization in
Tash-Murkon.

Rise in Popularity Across the Empire
------------------------------------

Following the terrorist attack on the Theology Council station in
Pashanai which led to the death of [Mervan Moritok](62uL39LYMcFWZn6LqgdoNw),
Yonis publicly addressed the shaken
Empire. He pledged to leverage his personal power to ensure such events
did not occur in the Empire again.

Shortly after, Yonis announced his plans to begin an Empire-wide
speaking tour. He expressed a desire to connect with the "common people"
of the Empire, with a thirty-date tour planned. He began with an
engagement in Dam-Torsad attended by roughly a thousand, where he urged
listeners to focus on the "roots of the faith" and urged the embrace of
all who follow the Amarr religion. The initial engagements did
well. While some success was accorded simply to his celebrity, listeners
quickly came to appreciate his message as well, and the positive
reaction encouraged Yonis to extend the tour.

In an unusual move, Yonis began holding public court within his domains
following each speaking engagement. While Heirs traditionally hear from
their Holders and other nobles, Ardishapur admitted commoners and
Holders alike to these courts. Ardishapur's rulings proved popular with
his subjects, who publicly praised him.

These public courts brought some ire down on Yonis from Imperial
authorities, after rumors began to circulate that he was offering
judgments outside of his realm. Following a speaking engagement in
Dantan in the Kador region, it was revealed that Yonis had mediated a
dispute between two Holders. Though Uriam Kador was pleased with his
intervention, Theology Council authorities believed the Heir had
overstepped his bounds by offering his judgment in another Heir's
territory.

As a result of his public courts and speaking engagement, a groundswell
of support for the Heir began to rise through the Empire. Disjointed
proposals for Yonis to receive more power in the Empire began to come
from many sectors. Yonis displayed modesty, reminding his followers that
only the Empress could grant him greater authority.

Other Activities
----------------

When Uriam Kador launched an incursion into Gallente Federation space,
Yonis considered the act another folly of his former closely allied
Heir. Privately, he distanced himself from Kador and effectively cut
ties with the [Kador Family](3ium7VluTCFnGS0TqpinlO).

When Jamyl I issued her emancipation decree, one Holder in the
Ardishapur domains falsified records to attempt to keep his slaves. The
Holder was stripped of his titles and holdings by the Theology Council
and the Ardishapur Family quickly moved to replace him.

When [Khanid II](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf) visited the Empire for the first
time in centuries, Yonis was the last Heir to arrive to the
meeting. During the several-day long meeting, Yonis departed
abruptly, leaving his nephew Arim to deal in his stead. Though he
left with the permission of the Empress to deal with matters inside his
domains, rumors spread that the Heir was unhappy with the nature of the
discussions. He did, however, return in time to be present as the
Empress announced that the Khanid Kingdom was to receive a full [Privy Council](privy-council) seat.
