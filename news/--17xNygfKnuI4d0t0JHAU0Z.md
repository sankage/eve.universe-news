# Intaki (System)
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/intaki-system

**Intaki** is the home system of a major [member](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn) of the [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and is located in the war zone.

While the system itself is resource-poor, it is still one of the wealthiest systems in the Federation. When conquered by the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) and auctioned off, a deal was made behind closed doors offering money and shipping rights to one of the megacorps as a way of mitigating the effects of Caldari ownership.

It was the location of Verine Veaulore's death.
