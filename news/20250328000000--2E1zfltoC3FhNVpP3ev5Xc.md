### Ministry of Internal Order Accuses Angels of Sabotage

A Hedion university research facility on Rumida II has been destroyed in a gas explosion. The Ministry of Internal Order has declared the explosion an act of sabotage, blaming the Angel Cartel for the apparent attack. The location was one of many Hedion University planetside facilities working on research and development projects in partnership with the Amarr Empire.

According to the MIO this was the latest in a series of suspected attempts by the Angel Cartel to disrupt Amarr research efforts. Other events cited included power blackouts, communication jamming attempts, and missing shipments. The MIO has refused to release any specifics on these supposed events. The Ministry has also denied independent investigators access to the facility on Rumida II, causing concerns over the validity of their claims.

The Ministry of Internal Order has been quick to act, conducting a number of raids on suspected Angel Cartel hideouts. According to the Ministry, there have been two hundred and seventeen “confirmed executions” but no arrests. Criminology experts have estimated that this would represent a tiny fraction of Angel operatives within the Empire. Amarr security forces have reported a rise in violent crimes associated with the Cartel, implying that the Angels may have been emboldened by the Ministry’s attempted crackdown.

While the MIO refused to comment on the nature of the research being disrupted, it is widely known that the Amarr and the Angel Cartel are in fierce competition for fifth place in the ongoing “Race for the Hives.” This is the ongoing competition to develop technology that will allow the occupation of Drifter wormhole systems. With only five Drifter Wormholes available, only the leading five factions will be successful.

Research teams in the Caldari State’s School of Applied Knowledge have reported that they are merely days away from making a final breakthrough in the development of Drifter Wormhole access technologies. As the competition enters its final stretch, it will be the actions of capsuleers that decides who gains access to this new frontier and leads the war against the Drifter menace.

### Race for the Hives Results in Full

This graph, and the information below, show each participating faction's share of the total contributions received up to this point:

- Triglavian - 26.4% (down 2.7%)
- Caldari - 14.2% (down 0.6%)
- Minmatar - 13.0 (down 1.3%)
- EDENCOM - 10.7% (up 1.1%)
- Angels - 9.9% (up 0.4%)
- Amarr - 9.6% (up 2.4%)
- Gallente - 5.6% (down 0.4%)
- SOCT - 3.9% (up 0.3%)
- Upwell - 3.7% (up 0.2%)
- EverMore	- 3.0% (down 0.4%)

### Analysis

The top positions remain steady despite shrinking gaps across the board. The Triglavians have safely secured first place, and the Caldari State have edged further ahead of the Minmatar, who still hold a secure third place. EDENCOM are similarly confident of success in fourth place, and have already begun to widen their recruitment base in anticipation of the coming change.

Most attention is being given to the battle for the final slot, with the Amarr creeping up on the Angels. The Empire and the criminal Cartel are neck to neck, and though the Angels still retain a slim lead, they will need to keep up their efforts as the Amarr advance.

The Gallente remain squarely in seventh place, the furthest back of any of New Eden’s major nations. The failure to inspire a competitive research program or gather dedicated capsuleer support has led President Celes Aguard’s political opponents to criticize her leadership.
