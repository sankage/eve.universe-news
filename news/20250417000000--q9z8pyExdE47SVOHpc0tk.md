### Drifters Advance as New Eden Fights Back
Drifters have escalated their conflict across New Eden and beyond as five factions take up occupancy of Drifter wormhole systems. These occupational forces have been enabled by new Drifter wormhole filaments developed as a result of the recent “Race for the Hives”. These filaments rely on remote access to the Warden in Zarzakh and allow groups of ships to move into specified Drifter wormholes. 

Simultaneously, structural shifts have been observed throughout Drifter wormhole systems for the first time in years. The previous Drifter complexes have reconfigured into labyrinthine constructs of reconfiguring space. Early hyperspace telemetry indicates these complexes only partially exist within observable space, with much of their structure extending into higher dimensions.

Even more troubling are the newly formed Nexus Points. Once a part of the Drifter complexes, these Nexus have separated into their own deadspace pockets. The mysterious structures within each Nexus have begun advancing as the linked Labyrinth Complexes iterate through their inscrutable machinations.

Scientists are at a loss to explain exactly what will occur should their advancement go unchallenged, but doomsday scenarios have been shared across the cluster. CONCORD has been quick to challenge these rumours, stating that whatever the Drifter plans may be, they will take some time to come to fruition. Meanwhile, occupying factions are struggling to maintain their influence over these systems against the growing Drifter strength.

### Azdaja Redoubt
An extensive Triglavian force has appeared in J174618, which has been given a new system designation. According to CONCORD’s linguistic specialists, it is now known as “Azdaja Redoubt” by the occupying forces. The Triglavians have set up a “Counter Domain” base of operations and shown a willingness to trade with those who have proven themselves against the Drifters. The Scope has picked up a broadcast from the Convocation of Triglav in Azdaja Redoubt:

*Reverse-time aggression from the Azdaja in forbidden dominance disrupts the Domain of Bujan. Recurring-time Azdaja conflict escalates disruption. Narodnya multitude lost. Koschoi multiutude lost. Navka multitude lost. Extirpation is the only advanced-time state for Ancient Enemy Azdaja.*

*Ancient-Domain allegiances are pravda when fitness is proven against Ancient Enemy Azdaja. Augmented Narodnya of proven fitness will receive glorification in the Counter Domain. Triumph is the only advanced-time context within the Flow of Vyraj.*

### Conflux Eyrie
“They dared attack New Caldari, they dared dishonor our home, now they will fall to the might of our great State.” These were the words spoken by Chairman Akimaka Saraki as a Caldari Navy  fleet established itself within the system formerly known as J200727. The fleet swiftly established the Caldari Navy Eyrie, a fortified location that has granted the system a new name, “Conflux Eyrie”. 

The Caldari Navy detachment also includes a number of specialists from the School of Applied Knowledge. These researchers are there to gather as much information as they can about the Drifter threat and their enigmatic technologies. They have broadcast a request for any items of interest to be brought to the Eyrie in exchange for equipment that will help in their war against the Drifters.

### Liberated Barbican
Reaching across the tribal divide, Brutor, Siebestor, and Thukker tribal chiefs have joined Sanmatar Malateu Shakor in leading a joint task force against the Drifters. Setting up base inside the wormhole formerly known as J110145, now dubbed “Liberated Barbican”, the Republic Fleet Liberation Outpost will act as a base of operation for the Minmatar military. “The attack on Tabbetzur was a crime we will not soon forget,” Sanmatar Shakor informed the media at a press conference alongside the tribal chiefs. “These Tyrants and their violence will no longer be tolerated.

The fleet’s stated operational goal is the liberation of the system from Drifter control. In addition, however, a number of Republic Security Service teams have joined the Republic Fleet base. These secret service operatives have been quiet about their interests, but the acquisition of technology is a known goal of the organization.

### Sentinel MZ
EDENCOM has declared the system formally designated J055520 an operational military zone, codenamed “Sentinel MZ”. A specially constructed fleet has fortified a position in the system to support those engaged in anti-Drifter operations. 

Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir has called the operation “EDENCOM’s boldest offensive since we first faced the Triglavian threat. Our forces are the best of the best, with the capsuleer’s aid, I have no doubt we will hold the line.” When asked how she felt about fighting on the same side of this conflict as the Triglavians, Valkanir was quick to respond, “We are not, nor shall we ever be, on their side. We are on the side of New Eden. If the Drifters and Trigs want to blow each other up while we’re busy securing peace for our cluster, so be it.”

### Sanctified Vidette
At a ceremony in J164710, Empress Catiz I herself has sanctified the system in the name of the Amarrian faith. During the holy ritual, she renamed the system “Sanctified Vidette”. The ceremony was celebrated across the Amarr Empire as a display of strength against the enemy that committed regicide against the Empress' predecessor, Empress Jamyl I. 

Shortly after it concluded, the Empress withdrew back to the Imperial Palace on Amarr Prime. The Imperial Navy has completed the construction of a militarized sanctuary on the site of her sanctification. In additional to its military contingent, members of the Imperial Academy and representatives from the Theological Council have taken up residency. According to official reports, these groups will be reviewing any findings from the conflict with the Drifters for potential value to the Empire as well as religious implications.
