A break free Day 3 of Alliance Tournament VII has successfully concluded.  
  
Last weekend saw most teams using extensive ECM and sub-battleship fleets, with the Rook and Drake dominating. Day One and Day Two also saw the use of 34 strategic cruisers. This was the first time the new ship class has ever been used in a tournament and they held up remarkably well, in some cases forcing a match to the time limit through sheer durability.
