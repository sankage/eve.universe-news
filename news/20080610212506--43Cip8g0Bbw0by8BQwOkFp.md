Kor-Azor Prime – Heavy fighting is underway in numerous locations throughout the Kor-Azor Region as a second titan-backed Minmatar-Thukker armada invaded the Amarr Empire. Multiple surface landings have been reported on planet Eclipticum, and Kor-Azor Family Bureau Headquarters Station has been stormed by elite mechanized troops. Kor-Azor’s independent security forces are defending against the onslaught on both land and in space, but the Minmatar-Thukker forces are overwhelming them with sheer numbers. 

Although the attack marks the first time in history that a foreign power has invaded sovereign Amarr territory, Imperial Navy warships have not yet moved to intercept them.
