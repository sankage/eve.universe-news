 **K25-XD, GEMINATE** \- Solar Fleet [SOLAR] unleashed multiple doomsday devices at 21:21 today on a 240 man starbase defense fleet composed of Wildly Inappropriate [WI], The Initiative [INIT.], and Majesta Empire [ME].  
  
Sources indicate Mostly Harmless [MH] was also enroute to assist but was forced to burn home after receiving reports of a Triumvirate [TRI] attack in progress.  
  
According to initial reports the double doomsday was largely ineffective and resulted in a significant number of friendly fire losses. At this time the three [SOLAR] titans (along with their support fleet) have left the field. The battle marks the beginning of what will likely be an intense weekend of fighting in Geminate.  
  
The conflict began on Thursday when [SOLAR] and [SOL-W] reinforced all Wildly Inappropriate [WI] sovereignty towers in K25-XD. According to [WI] spokesman Tomcat, the offensive came in response to [WI] assaults on three towers held by [SOLAR] in CFYY-J and U6D-9A.  
  
The remaining six reinforced [WI] towers in K25-XD are reported to be coming out of reinforced mode over the weekend at optimal times for [WI].  
  
Historically K25-XD has functioned as a pivotal system for defenders of Geminate. Earlier this year it served as the center point of United Freeman Alliance's [UFA] unsuccessful bid to defend its Geminate territory against [WI]. K25-XD is one of a handful of station systems in the region and well defended against conventional attacks due to its location deep within the region.  
  
The extent of the current hostilities has yet to be seen. NC forces are currently heavily engaged in the north and south as well as the Drone Regions to a lesser extent. The opening of another front with a potentially powerful enemy would certainly add an additional element to an already complex situation.  
  
More information to come as the weekend progresses.
