## Gallente Federation

Perhaps the most controversial of all the empires, the Gallente Federation is many different things—depending on who you ask. To their supporters, they are the largest and most enduring democracy in New Eden and a bastion for equality and justice. To their detractors, they are velvetgloved imperialist bullies, incapable of truly acknowledging any culture other than their own.

Life in the federation has often been described as utopian, and provided you are privileged enough to live in the luxury of the core worlds, this is likely true. As long as people don’t cause harm to others, they are allowed to live their lives more or less in whatever manner they please. Poets, scholars, and politicians are revered, with citizens often flocking in droves to adopt the latest cause, movement, fad, or combination thereof. Opportunity is abundant. Life is easy and free of want.

Of course, this freedom comes at a price. Vice runs rampant in the federation. Fulfilling any desire you may possess is a simple matter. Things that might be considered immoral or illegal in the rest of the cluster tend to be readily accessible here. Drugs, body modification, prostitution, gambling: if you have the money, virtually anything that can be imagined can be enjoyed.

It’s not all debauchery, though; there exists a heavily right-wing movement among the Gallente. These nationalistic groups feel the roots of the federation are slowly being eroded by outside influences. To their mind the federal way is the only way. Let the masses have their drug orgies, blissfully unaware that their privilege to do so exists only because certain people are willing to do the more unpalatable work that must be done. And should anyone object to these powers, well, people have been known to disappear into the morass of federation society.

Despite its flaws, the federation is still held up as a bulwark of freedom and individuality, and remains a land of opportunity where the outcast and discontent can seek comfort and succor.
