Sarum Prime - Following the news of the massed Minmatar-Thukker task force invading Amarr sovereign territory, the planet 'Mekhios' have become the scene for mass public executions as Amarrian ground forces attempt to remove the threat of rebellious slaves before they are exposed to Insorum by the invading forces. 

Reports are coming in that Minmatar-Thukker forces are rapidly approaching the Sarum core worlds, with little in the way to slow them down.
