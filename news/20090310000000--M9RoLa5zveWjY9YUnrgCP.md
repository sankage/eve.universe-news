CARROU 0912 - President Foiritan has authorized the immediate mobilization of "Tripwire" defenses along the constellation border separating the Gallente Federation and the Caldari State, escalating tensions between the two warring nations. The act follows the sudden and mysterious loss of contact with the planet Seyllin I. Although the measure is being called "precautionary" by Federation officials, many view the act as reckless given the dangers inherent to such large war fleets operating in proximity to each other.

Analysts have stated that the lack of communication with Seyllin I means an attack on the planet cannot be ruled out, as fluid router hubs are typically the first targets of any orbital bombardment or commando-style operation.

The Caldari Navy has responded in kind, mobilizing its forces along its border in what appears to be a purely defensive posture. State Executor Tibus Heth is expected to issue a statement to address these developments within the hour.
