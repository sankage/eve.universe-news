**Victor Sistre** is a [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) trader. He is
part of the Canout corporation and was tasked with finding rare minerals
for the corp's shield production. One day while idling in a cargo ship
in [Manatirid](3CA7V5w1FcWFck3mN8b0qi), a frigate from Jaasinen Inc. - a
corp at war with his - undocked and attacked him. Victor tried to warp
off, but failed and was scrambled. His anti-scrambling measures failed
and his ship was destroyed, leaving him to wonder if he shouldn't have
just made a burn for the station.
