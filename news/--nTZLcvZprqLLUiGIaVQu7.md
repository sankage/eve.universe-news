# Council of Apostles
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/council-of-apostles

The **Council of Apostles** was the ruling body of the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) prior to the Moral Reforms. In those days, the
[Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) was the head of the Apostles
Council, as first among equals.

The Council was at one point usurped by Zaragram II, who proclaimed himself the divine
manifestation of God. After Zaragram's death, the Council did its best
to erase all history of him and for a short time became extremely
powerful. This power eventually led to the Moral Reforms.

It was dissolved during the Moral Reforms, where much of its powers were
transferred to the Emperor and the Privy Council. Many of its records and
artifacts were preserved by the Order of St. Tetrimon.
