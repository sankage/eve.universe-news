# Military Drones
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/military-drones

**Military drones** were an evolution of mines developed by the
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) as a countermeasure to
[Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) fighters and raiding tactics.

At first little more than homing mines, they quickly evolved to their
current state where [drones](3o5QhCbx71nILKNnW9S7v1) were a match for
the [one-manned fighters](2zJdxBu7hlAbyrhkl5sLou), and their
cheaper price tags made the fighters obsolete. The Caldari had no
recourse until the [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) gifted them with
[capsule](2klMsyfd5quK05XnGL9wNB) technology.
