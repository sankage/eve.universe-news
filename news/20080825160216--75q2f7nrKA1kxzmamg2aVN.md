Dastryns - Health officials from the Federation Administration Bureau Offices located in the Dastryns system are reporting an outbreak of illness among the station management and VIPs. Station services and general staffing have not been affected, and Gallente officials emphasized that neither station nor system security are affected by the outbreak.

Station medical experts have been unable to isolate the cause of the illness; the affliction has some similarities to known bacterial infections. Symptoms of the illness include extreme sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and dizziness. Antibiotic treatment has been ineffective, though treatment of the symptoms has been reported as successful.

An estimated 6500 individuals have been affected, but station officials are quick to note that only a fraction of those individuals are considered "at risk." Station residents and visitors are being asked to remain calm, and medical officials have asked for anyone to visit the nearest clinic if they experience any of the listed symptoms.
