Despite even odds, a State Protectorate fleet of almost 80 pilots was crushed this evening by a Federal Defence fleet in Tama. 

Elijah Ghost's fleet arrived in Tama with only minutes to spare before the State Protectorate fleet warped in on them. Targets were called with confidence and dispatched with ease. 

Final assessments indicate the State Protectorate lost 75% - 80% of their fleet in this engagement. With losses barely above 25%, the Federal Defence fleet easily won the day. 

In a disturbing show of cowardice, several State Protectorate pilots were seen outside of the station shooting at the capsules of Federal Defence pilots trying to return to their bases.
