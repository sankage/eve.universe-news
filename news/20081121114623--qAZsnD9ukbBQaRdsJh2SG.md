Kador Prime - The heavy fighting that just moments ago was occurring in Kador Prime seems to have ceased, all reports coming in indicate that the Federation Navy vessels that were involved in the combat have left the system.

We have no further sightings of the Federation Navy fleet and we have no further information at this time.
