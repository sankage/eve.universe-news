# Mister B
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/mister-b

**Mister B** is employed by an unnamed [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ)
and, along with [Mister H](oozD2ZbqZvu1AGLUnlx1j), rescues a base-liner
named [Rokan](7h4XGy7U2yQbO6l9PP9IsT) from being beaten to death by security
guards, in order to pitch a job to Rokan. In actual fact, Mister B and
his companion wish to turn Rokan into a test subject to further their
research for the capsuleer into how capsuleers might better interface
with ships and ship systems. Rokan, with his talent for bypassing
security systems, appears to be an ideal candidate for such research
even though he isn't a capsuleer. Their initial tests on Rokan alter his
perceptions of what is happening to him and Mister B is not surprised
when Rokan happily 'volunteers' for the work.
