# Merial Akalayan
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/merial-akalayan

Dr. **Merial Akalayan** is senior assistant to Dr. Chieran Kenitawri and
a scientist in her own right. After Chieran assigns her to a weeks-long
research project reviewing virtually abandoned archives, Merial comes
across a startling discovery: an artifact recently retrieved from
wormhole space near [Akora](5W5xBtHU03t8vQzhgMujc1) in the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) bears a striking resemblance to one excavated
sometime during the previous century on [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6), which
is nearly five light-years away from Akora. Both objects are around
fifteen thousand years of age. Merial postulates they are a kind of
ancient fractal acceleration shell equalizer due to their similar design
regarding a series of nodes present on each. This discovery excites both
her and Chieran because the size of the artifacts suggests the
corresponding ship engines would have been enormous, larger even than a
modern dreadnought.
