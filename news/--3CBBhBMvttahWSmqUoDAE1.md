# Relay Tower
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/relay-tower

The **Relay Tower** was one of the main backbones of the
[FTL communications network](slULqrFiu06fLmeraX1QL) owned by
several providers and supervised by [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt). It
was a dark, foreboding complex in the middle of nowhere, closer to Yulai
than any other system. The CRC had staff on-site.
