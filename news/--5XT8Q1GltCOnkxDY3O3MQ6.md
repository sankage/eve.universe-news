# Blood Raider Covenant
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/blood-raider-covenant

The Amarr Empire has had its share of religious cults and fanatics in the past, but few have been as successful, or been feared as much, as the Blood Raiders. The Blood Raiders are a sect of an ancient cult called [Sani Sabik](TDJbDXVg3cRp4b6FEkkFS), which uses blood in their rituals. The Blood Raiders believe that cloned bodies have 'purer' blood than other bodies and this explains why they operate mainly in space, attacking unwary space farers and draining their bodies of blood.

The Blood Raiders are led by the fearsome [Omir Sarikusa](6UYaNpBPqY1ls1ps78PPPt), who has remained at the top of the DED's most wanted list for many years now. Under his leadership the Blood Raiders have become more organized and they have established several bases in the Bleak Lands region.
