# Luecin Rileau
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/luecin-rileau

**Luecin Rileau** was the Gallente Federation ambassador to the Caldari
State, and the son of "the diamond-king" [Darouen Rileau](6bU1NaQ5PFYNH9YhorJMc2). He is famous for having been
kidnapped by [Fatal](2cUo2UbsCruVr7VsIHmw1N) and the
[Rabbit](3Mb6UfjhKf0MdSbbR4a2EU) in their most celebrated heist, a
brilliant feat that clearly demonstrated that Fatal and the Rabbit were
far from being the stereotypical brainless brats that most people
regarded pirates to be.

Kidnapping
----------

Luecin had only one noticeable vice: gambling. His gambling fascination
was probably the main reason why he had sought to become the
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) ambassador to the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy), a notoriously tricky position.

Ambassador Rileau frequented the Grand Tiegjon Casino in the [Echelon Entertainment](18L4RdCXWRddhsDTuM9hlG) Studio station in the
Caldari system of Vellaine. It was there that Fatal and the Rabbit
struck.

The two of them docked at the station under in disguise. The Rabbit
(Kosakami) stayed behind in the ship while Fatal (Laitanen) entered the
casino. Fatal involved himself in a game of
[Pettokori](atO9Ra9b9kPw6pduA5tbq), a popular electro-board gambling
game, which Rileau was participating in. In the course of the game,
Fatal deliberately lost money to the ambassador and finally, when he'd
run out of money, Fatal offered his ship to the ambassador. The
ambassador accepted and proceeded to win the game. Fatal offered to show
the ambassador his newly won ship and Rileau, accompanied by several
bulky bodyguards, accepted.

But while the game was underway the Rabbit had been busy. He rigged the
boarding ramp to the ship with tanks filled with sleeping gas. Needless
to say, when the ambassador and his bodyguards entered the boarding
ramp, they were promptly put to sleep. Ambassador Rileau was then
carried into the ship and Fatal and the Rabbit innocently left the
station. It was only when another ship docked in the same berth an hour
later and discovered the boarding ramp full of snoring bodyguards that
the alarm was raised, but by then the kidnappers were long gone.

The Gallente Federation was unable to apprehend the culprits and in the
end the ambassador's family paid a huge ransom in uncut diamonds to the
[Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO). All this drama received a great deal of
media attention.
