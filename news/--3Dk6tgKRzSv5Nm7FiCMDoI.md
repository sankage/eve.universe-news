# Beliah
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/beliah

**Beliah** is a student at [Republic University](5MIk5pq00NX5NDS9mcLcpv) whose time was mostly spent with the political and sociology students discussing revolution. Young, idealistic, and passionate, she admired [Karin Midular](3KxlNVAeglPj5ZH0sf3U2j) but felt, as her friends did, that [Maleatu Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV) should be leader.

When she discovered her mother was dating an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) she ran to her favorite hiding place, the roof of their building. Her surrogate Grandmother, Gran, tracked her down and explained how Beliah's mother was a [Daughter of the Revolution](5cNK0teHN5X2tixANHvsmg) and what that means.
Beliah, who Gran calls 'Little Bird', left the roof with a more balanced view.
