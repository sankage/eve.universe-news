An Echelon Entertainment film crew inside Jarizza has released startling images of the initial moments of attack inside the system. On location capturing footage for an upcoming documentary on interstellar trading, the crew became unwitting front line observers to the conflict. 

Heavily distorted from the electromagnetic interference as Cynosural fields littered the starry backdrop, the footage depicted dozens of Naglfar-class Dreadnoughts deploying in the system. Ammatar security forces present were seen being summarily obliterated by an overwhelming mass of support vessels weaving their way around the behemoth warships. Moments before the Director pulled his people back, the footage showed the entrance of what has now been confirmed to be a Ragnarok-class Titan to the field.
