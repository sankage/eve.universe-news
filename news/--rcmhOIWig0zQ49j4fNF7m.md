# Seyllin I
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/seyllin-i

Seyllin I is a planetary mass in the [Seyllin](1SX3stmn3UJS4nAXLNeUsG)
system in the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK). It was once a
barren, blasted world that was nevertheless colonized and exploited for
its massive heavy metal resources. The planet was destroyed during an
event known as the Seyllin Incident, rending it little more than a
fractured collection of coalescing rubble.

Pre-Disaster
------------

Deep within Federation space, Seyllin I was devoid of any atmosphere, a
hellish world whose daytime temperatures soared high enough to turn lead
into molten slag. Underneath the surface was an abundance of heavy
metals that drew [Braggs Seyllin](M0L4cbMHN6vXCjNtKGIsw) to found a
community here. In the mined excavation sites where thick veins of
precious ore once lay, intersecting caverns big enough to house capital
ships were illuminated in gentle cycles with artificial sunlight; water
ran in streams and falls throughout a cityscape that was equal parts
lush vegetation and stylish living quarters; atmosphere scrubbers worked
with the ecosystem to recycle air and push a comfortable breeze
throughout the miles of interconnecting city blocks and work centers.

Its four main cities, Lodecore, Metal City, Southern Cross, and Valimor
were thriving, pulsing cityscapes interconnected by magrail systems that
spanned around the entire planet. Access points for each of the main
cities littered the surface of Seyllin I. The most common of these were
spaceports, which allowed dropships to transfer passengers and cargo
within the safety of shielded containment fields.

The planet hosted several space elevators for heavy freight, but these
could only be operated at night due to the extreme daytime temperatures.
Just beneath these access points was a network of operational support
structures and the [Cassandra](47YuBR3HlvNeGKVgVupGVx) monitoring site.

Disaster
--------

On March 10, YC111, the planet was struck by two consecutive disasters
originating from its sun. The first, which struck at around 8:49 [EVE Standard Time](2cJeP2eBHll85PfjQlTtHt), was a pulse of radiation that
killed thousands on the planet's sun-side surface and caused acute
radiation poisoning in those beneath the sun-side surface. The
second occurred several hours later, when a large mass of plasma ejected
from the star struck the planet. The collision destroyed the planet,
killing the population that had not been evacuated.

Following the planet's destruction, its remnants remained
gravitationally bound and slowly began to collapse back into a planet.
Once this process is complete, the planet's structure could be
drastically changed, but should still contain the majority of its metal
deposits. However, this process is expected to take thousands of years.
