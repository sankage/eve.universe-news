# Station Windows
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/station-windows

**Station windows** refers to the translucent panes on the exterior of
stations that allow views of space and local celestials. These windows
are constructed of a variety of durable materials and come in numerous
shapes and sizes. As these windows directly touch the vacuum of space,
they can be extremely cold if they are not near enough to and do not
face the local star.

Construction
------------

Most station windows are thick, double-paned sheets of
[transparent nanoalloy](22EmoWbZo7FbrFrMfGfcfH). This alloy is incredibly
strong and resistant to breakage and rarely needs reinforcement. Between
the two panes is typically an insulating, colorless gas such as argon to
help minimize heat transfer between the vacuum and the station interior.

### Temperature Control

Even with such measures, windows can grow quite cold if the station is
far from the sun or it is facing away from it. In most cases the windows
are simply allowed to remain cold. Some stations, particularly in
quarters or areas designed for the wealthy, install microfilament
heating elements in the windows. While this is extremely energy
inefficient, the extra comfort given is a considered a mild luxury.

On stations near hot stars, windows are usually not installed to face
the sun. This is primarily for comfort, as the light of the star can
quickly make the area around the window uncomfortably hot. On the rare
occasions when such windows are installed (typically in luxury suites),
they are usually tinted to reduce this effect, and costly
[cooling systems](8jV5skXRF2j1CwMtllduU) are installed to keep the
air from overheating.

### Environmental Effects

For stations that are near dust and gas clouds, planetary rings, or
other sources of fine debris, the windows can be crisscrossed with
wiring that produces a mild negative charge, repelling the dust and
keeping the windows clean. If such measures are not installed, the
windows can quickly become opaque and require constant cleaning.

### Combat Precautions

In the event of an attack, windows constitute major weak points. This
danger can be mitigated somewhat by the installation of ballistic
filters and particle screens. These are expensive and are typically
aesthetically displeasing, so they are typically only permanently
installed in nullsec outposts, control towers, and other structures at
constant threat of assault.
