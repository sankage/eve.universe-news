An eccentric but fabulously rich [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
entrepreneur, **Lous Chavol** founded [The Scope](jKoaYpOfHALTiwPIlGbE6)
a century and a half ago. Chavol had made his fortune with one of the
more successful communication companies that sprang up after [Faster Than Light Communication](7Eqc0yOgUoUswOop0Q2uMQ) were discovered. Through
his communication company Chavol had access to massive amount of
information and it was a logical step for him to use this as a basis for
a media company.
