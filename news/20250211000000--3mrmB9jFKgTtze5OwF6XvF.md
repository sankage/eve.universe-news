### Empress Praises Victors of Tash-Murkon
Tash-Murkon Prime, Tash-Murkon — Empress Catiz I greeted crowds at the Winter Palace of House Tash-Murkon following the first successful destruction of a Vigilant Dreamer in their home system. The Empress' own Royal House declared a region-wide day of celebration following the explosion of the Drifter-controlled structure by capsuleers.

“Almost nine and a half years ago, my predecessor was assassinated by a fleet of the same profane monstrosities that plague our heavens once more,” The Empress began, “They dared to try usurp our Lord’s will and challenge our faith. Well, the faithful have risen to that challenge like a righteous flame! In these skies, as in Kobam and in Anath, we have proved that none can stand against us!”

Those gathered erupted in cheers. The Empress also took the time to read the honors list of pilots who claimed victory against the Vigilant Dreamer, awarding the newly minted “Tash-Murkon Dreambreaker Shield” to the following pilots; 5kyscreamx (who struck the final blow), Ada May, Alicia Evelyn, Andrius Uhad, Balio Sof, Beauregard Jefferson III, Billsonian, CHA0S1298, chaos1298, CasperLouise, D-Apostle-17, Dabbington, DutchGunner, elpuffington, FaceEatingTumor, Law1127, Loregar, Plugnplay, Rimtas Juokas, Scootzaar Anneto, Stavri, Tokar Zeminev, Toroi Kanto, Velln Moonshatter.

Lord Tunir Tash-Murkon, heir and head of House Tash-Murkon, welcomed the empresses' words, adding his gratitude for the support of the other Heirs during this trying time. The other Royal Houses have historically held mixed sentiments towards the Tash-Murkon. Their Udorian heritage and pragmatic economic approach have caused some members of the Holder caste to join militant terrorist organizations like the Disciples of Purity (formerly Purity of the Throne) rather than acknowledge Empress Catiz Tash-Murkon I as their ruler. Today, not a single negative sentiment could be found in print regarding the House as people took to the streets to celebrate across the Empire. Lord Arim Ardishapur even went as far as to call their victory “a sign of divine purpose”, going on to say that “in this time of conflict, we are blessed to have an Empress from such a resilient people.”

### First Triumphs Claimed by Caldari and Minmatar while Federation Struggles
The victory over Tash-Murkon Prime was one of eight Drifter retreats across the cluster. The Caldari were the first to push them back in Ichinumi, shortly followed by the Minmatar Republic in Geffur. Both Caldari and Amarr have claimed a total of three victories over Drifter forces, with the Minmatar claiming two. Despite providing the first warnings of the incoming Drifter attacks, the Gallente Federation has yet to secure a system against the invaders.

Chairman Akimaka Saraki has once again commended State forces and capsuleers alike for their successes in Ichinumi, Silen, and Ruvas. “Swift in their response, our loyal ships were the first to force a Drifter retreat. A unified and disciplined response with capsuleer support has proven once more to be the key that unlocks triumph.” Megacorporations Lai Dai, Sukuuvestaa, and Hyasyoda joined the chairman in his praise as their stations within the affected systems were able to return to business as usual. Saraki commented that, “When faced with an outside threat, there are no factions, only Caldari.” 

Despite their initial lack of preparation, an incredible effort by Minmatar forces and their capsuleer allies was more than enough to defeat the Drifters first in Geffur, then in Nein. Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor has cited these victories as “proof of the importance of tribal unity.” Thukker Chief Ennar Aeboul who has been openly critical of the Republic’s response declined to comment. 

Elsewhere in the Republic, the citizens of Hadozeko were not so fortunate. The Command Operations system's military bases remain secure in their endless war with the Amarr, but many of their clans have suffered massive losses to the Drifters. Similar hardships were felt in the Caldari system Fuskunen, and all across the Federation.

The first to warn of the coming Crisis, the Gallente Federation has suffered most greatly as it unfolds. The systems of Hare, Niballe, and Gererique all experienced significant losses despite capsuleers' best efforts. President Celes Aguard has called once more for capsuleers to “join us in standing up for liberty. These invaders openly call themselves tyrants, they must not be allowed to harm our citizens. Even now they attack us once more in Nausschie, Ravarin, and Uphene. It is up to us to secure the future of our democracy, our liberty, against these aggressors.”

### SOCT Updates Dreamer Tracking as Drifters Alter Tactics
Using telemetry gathered during the Vigilant Dreamer’s destruction in Tash-Murkon, the Society of Conscious Thought has been able to synthesize new upgrades for Crisis response fleets. Targeting computer modifications and improved hyperspace tracking methodologies will ensure Vigilant Dreamers remain available for assault as long as they are in a system. 

At the same time, however, SOCT intel indicates that Drifters are committing to more persistent Vigilant Dreamer deployments. Dreamers are now expected to remain in system until they have completed their task or are destroyed in the attempt. This will mean no more retreats by Drifter forces as long as their Vigilant Dreamers remain operational.

The SOCT has also observed a spike in Drifter hyperspace communication traffic throughout the Amarr Empire simultaneous with drops in traffic throughout Gallente space. These changes followed the recent successes against the Drifters in Amarr space, along with uninterrupted streams from Drifter sites in Federation space.

### News in Brief
