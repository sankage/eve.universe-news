# Year YC105

May
---

A dramatic increase in space
travelers within regions traditionally associated with pirates lead the
[DED](1xZoOUsqaDhJw7gQffHMFC) to instigate and enforce new directives in
interstellar law enforcement. This marked the beginning of the DED's
(and [CONCORD's](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt)) controversial and secretive chain
of operations through the first part of the year. The four empires ran
into problems with independent "rogue miners," who were harvesting
asteroid belts previously staked for the empires' use. These
difficulties were addressed with increased cooperation between CONCORD
and empire navies, but by the time this arrangement was established much
of the rare ore had been harvested already. Sad times for the
empires' coffers, but lucrative ones for
the freelancers.

June
----

 Early in June, the
[SCC](7v1HmgfP9wx45IXYZCbWbK) briefly stepped into the
interstellar media spotlight by mediating the long-standing
disagreements between academics of all stripes and the manufacturers of
the skill packs their work was put into. This dispute, dubbed by pundits
"the Second [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV)" due
to the nationalities of the corporations and schools most vocal in the
dispute (the [CBD Corporation](7o6AuVZhnq4lIzIMdYdMft) and the
[University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM)), had escalated
into an all-out strike which cut off the availability of skill packs in
most colonized regions of the universe. Twenty-four hours later, the SCC
had agreed upon emergency legislation which re-established order in the
marketplace, and were hailed as saviors by starving academics and
starship pilots alike

June also saw the emergence of a new breed of terrorist, one without
apparent political aims. Early in the month, CONCORD issued a travel
warning to all those passing through the Obe system, stating that
"unknown marauders" had been preying on innocent traders. This was only
the first of many outbreaks of lawlessness within empire borders, and
CONCORD found itself forced to deploy Special Ops units to keep the
marauders at bay. Throughout the month, much speculation surrounded the
methods CONCORD would utilize to stem this crime tide, most of which
were neither disclosed to press nor public, but which would prove
extremely effective. CONCORD's first step in this direction was the
publishing of the first interstellar Most Wanted List, which was
initially topped by the infamous marauder Lord Zap.

On the 26th of June citizens of the empires celebrated the First Contact
Festival marking the 105th anniversary of the Yoiul Conference, that
historic meeting of minds where the guidelines for Trans-Empire peace
and cooperation were originally set. First Contact Festivals are a time
of chaotic revelry and this year's was no exception, as whole systems
shut down their commercial operations and gave themselves to the
celebration.

July
----

 At the beginning of July
CONCORD pulled two aces out of its sleeve: we saw the arrival of the new
superhighway system they had been touting for months previously, and we
suddenly saw automated armaments at every empire [jump gate](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) we went to. The new spacelanes, combined
with CONCORD's increased presence and subsequent quelling of the crime
tide, ushered in an era of tremendous economic growth. The robotics
industry alone reported an almost 200% increase in revenue over the
course of the next months, as independent traders and corporations alike
were able to take to their business without fear for their lives.

Around the middle of the month, news leaked from the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) that negotiations for a major research
pact between the Federation and the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)
were underway. Initially neither side could be reached for confirmation
but as the days passed and the world watched, more rumors circulated and
more details came to light. On the 27th of the month, the two
governments released a joint statement announcing the existence of the
[Crielere Research Laboratories](3Y34ZySL2hebLjco1Y25IK), a cooperative project
involving some of the two empires' best scientific minds. The project
was hailed by many as a triumph for Gallente-Caldari relations, and
described by analysts as "a milestone to remember for these two former
enemies."

This month also saw [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV) as the surprise recipient of the [Aidonis Foundation's award](2ZdUwi6lEN75YZoamvXA72) for his contributions to
inter-stellar peace and improved empire relations. The announcement came
as a shock to many, even prompting violent attacks from
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) rebel factions, but most political
analysts agreed that Heideran was well deserving of the award, citing
his tireless efforts to thaw out the icy walls built between Amarr and
the other empires over the last centuries and temper the aggressive
tendencies of his massive nation.

August
------

 In August the universe was held in
rapt attention as news filtered out that a [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G)
admiral named [Ouria](2Og5aR1ZiiVEYPgx9FJcPg) had gone rogue after giving away
a high-technology item to a non-Jove, thus violating the
non-interference law imposed by the Jove directorate upon all its
subjects. Ouria's defection was discovered when word spread of a secret
meeting taking place somewhere in the Stain region of space between a
group of Jove and an unknown party. During this meeting, an
[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) pilot who had been determined to investigate
the proceedings was shot down by Jove ships, sparking a diplomatic
incident between the two empires. Following this, the Jove released the
information that Admiral Ouria had been stricken with the deadly
psychological disorder known as the [Jovian Disease](23mdEc1035XOWRcmorPJYf) and declared him an exile from the
Jove Empire, disavowing responsibility and denouncing his actions.
CONCORD went one step further, placing a 100 million ISK bounty on his
head.

Reports continued to resurface sporadically from the Stain region, where
Ouria's renegade band was rumored to be scouting around for territories
to set up operations in. Their attempts were met with sustained
resistance from the corporations of the Stain Alliance and after one
particularly bloody and decisive battle, Ouria managed to escape into
hiding. A few days later, information came to light that Ouria had
developed ties with the infamous Minmatar rebel faction Oracle and
rumors circled that he was in talks with them about an alliance. After
managing to intercept communications between Ouria and one of his
brothers, CONCORD was able to issue a general warning for the sectors of
Stain space where the Admiral was believed to be located. Following this
narrowing of the field, a massive fleet of Stain Alliance ships tracked
down and engaged Ouria and his contingent of Oracle soldiers, defeating
the Jovian and his Minmatar cohorts after a long and bloody struggle.

Also in August, Amarr-Minmatar relations took a drastic turn for the
worse when an Amarr ambassador was shot down by a squadron of Minmatar
rebels on his way into [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) space. The motives
for the attack became clear when it was revealed that the ambassador had
been carrying top-secret intelligence documents intended for the
[Ammatar Consulate](LxRVvJ2TIDlhoEWiTfKF2), detailing the names
and locations of known Minmatar rebel leaders, their bases and defenses.
It was believed this was to have been the first step by the Amarr
towards quelling the rising tide of Minmatar incursions into Ammatar
space by applying tactical strikes to key rebel targets. Following the
incident a familiar dance played itself out between the two nations: the
Minmatar Republic deplored the raid whilst denying any knowledge of it,
and the Amarr Empire countered that the Republic's inability to control
their own people was inexcusable, clearly placing the responsibility in
the Republic's hands.

Aran'gar of the Bleak Cabal, one of the raiders involved in the attack,
when interviewed from an undisclosed location somewhere inside Minmatar
space, released a statement characteristic to the climate of increasing
hostility the next months would bring: "My duty is to save those who are
enslaved. I do not expect the Amarr to understand this, but as long as
they keep innocent people as slaves their citizens will suffer my
wrath."

September
---------

 September saw what was perhaps the year's
greatest single shift in the interstellar political climate: the passing
of Amarr Emperor Heideran VII. Following announcements earlier in the
month that the Emperor had fallen ill, and subsequent expressions of
concern from world leaders and massive vigils held by the Emperor's
loyal subjects, on the 17th it was declared that Heideran VII had
departed this mortal coil. The news sent shockwaves reverberating
throughout the four empires, resulting in record instability of markets
and universal uncertainty over what the future would hold. In response
the Amarr Imperial Succession Committee went to work right away, setting
in motion plans for the [Amarr Imperial Championship](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx), an event that would decide
which of the five ruling houses' heirs would succeed Heideran to the
throne. Details of this Championship were leaked from the committee late
in the month, revealing that the Champions - combat pilots who would
get the chance to compete, one for each house, alongside three wingmen
in closed frigate battles -- were to be selected via a popular vote, as
a gesture of commitment to the departed emperor's legacy of honoring the
traditions of other nations. This enraged various fundamentalist
factions within Amarr, most notably [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L), who released a scathing public statement
denouncing the decision as "heretical."

More fighting took place between Amarr and Minmatar pilots after a ship
carrying several hundred freed slave children was attacked and destroyed
en route to Minmatar space, where they were to have started new lives
among relatives in the Republic. Investigations into the atrocity
revealed that a small fanatical Amarr religious cult named
[Tetrimon](4Z9IYnlIENaSBblXROhEfY) ("Divine Devotion") had
been responsible. Amid cries for blood from outraged Minmatar
everywhere, a squad of fierce Minmatar warriors tracked down and killed
two of the cult's high priestesses. The cult has not been heard from
since, though a number of its members are believed to be still at large.

October
-------

 October was the month of
the Amarr Championships. Throughout the month, cunning commanders and
their fearless wingmen swooped through the Amarr skies, each championing
their cause in the most literal way imaginable. The Empire watched
raptly as the Champions, through their actions, determined the course of
their collective future. After a series of thrilling matches which
spanned the course of two weeks and featured some of the finest tactics
ever seen on a battlefield, only one Champion stood left: Ecliptical,
Champion of the [House of Kor-Azor](1S0FEGgzJiwc4yXaG5AzjD).

In October we also saw the first seedlings of the Protein Delicacies
fiasco take root. Late in the month, the [Sukuuvestaa Corporation](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB) released the by-now
infamous line of food products, hailed as revolutionary at the time due
to their low price, great flavor and incredible production efficiency.
The Gallente Federation's Department of Education didn't take long to
see the economic benefits, and within days had signed a deal with the
Sukuuvestaa Corporation to supply all Gallente schools with the new
wonder food, which would save the Department billions of ISK that could
be used for reforms elsewhere in the education system.

November
--------

 During the last days of October and
throughout the beginning of November reports began to come in of
decreasing test scores within the Gallente school system, as well as an
increase in student truancy and disciplinary problems. An investigative
committee was assembled to search for the reasons behind this sudden
drop, but made little headway initially. A few days later, the [Quafe Company](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6) suddenly released information that
proved beyond doubt that the main ingredients in the Protein Delicacies
were in fact organic waste, processed station sewage and second grade
biomass. The Caldari State's [Chief Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr) was quick to respond, promising
that an investigation would be undertaken to determine whether there was
cause for further action in the matter.

Some days later, the Gallente Federal [Senate](x8brOPuT22Bcly2Sikkt5) lodged
a formal inquiry as to how the Sukuuvestaa Corporation had managed to
conceal the dubious origin of their food product from health boards and
other agencies. At about the same time, the Suukuvestaa Corporation
suddenly released a statement on the issue, denouncing the Quafe
Company's "deplorable" industrial espionage and accusing the popular
soft-drink manufacturer of having intended to steal the manufacturing
process for the Protein Delicacies. Interestingly, the Suukuvestaa
statement made no mention whatsoever of the delicacies' unsavory
contents, a clear indicator to some that they were apathetic to the
situation.

It was about this time that the Gallente investigative committee
delivered their findings: apparently, studies indicated a clear link
between consumption of Protein Delicacies and decreasing cognitive
ability. This prompted a moral outcry from the Federation's citizens, as
well as a formal request from the Federation to the Caldari State
demanding indemnities for the selling of the contaminated products. The
Chief Executive Panel convened for the decision, and two days later
released a statement saying that "The business practices employed in the
manufacturing and marketing of the Protein Delicacies were not
significantly different from what normally takes place in a capitalistic
economy, and there is unsatisfactory evidence to suggest any deliberate
foul play at work."

This prompted an uproar within the Federation Senate, many senators
taking extreme stances and some even going as far as to suggest a
renewal of the war. The [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E) and the
Federal Cabinet were less outspoken on the matter, but persistent rumors
circulated that [President Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) was
deliberating on some ways to "get back" at the Caldari. Whether or not
this is true has not become clear yet, but one thing remains certain:
Gallente-Caldari relations, which had been steadily improving over the
past years, have with this incident taken their biggest single downturn
since the war between the two nations still raged.

November also saw the award ceremony for the Championships, and later
the historic inauguration of the new Amarr Emperor, [Doriam Kor-Azor](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT). The ceremony was held at the end of the
month at an undisclosed location, and was described by some as the most
tense moment in modern Amarr history. It began, as all Amarr
inauguration ceremonies have begun throughout the ages, with the ritual
suicide -- or [Shathol'Syn](7uCmeRGL3bgVWlEWQ9TZQb) -- of the contending
houses' heirs. Just as it was Jamyl Sarum's turn to end her life,
however, warships from the [Sarum](4EZ4a3Mw8QXHmisAA4Ff6L) fleet
interrupted the ceremony, launching missiles at Kor-Azor's ship. Sarum
ordered them off, and immediately thereafter prematurely performed the
Shathol'Syn without naming an [heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) to her
dynasty, thus leaving her estate essentially headless. Despite this
jarring event the ceremony continued as planned, with Kor-Azor
delivering a rousing speech where he stated his intentions to bring
peace and prosperity through negotiations and goodwill. The ceremony was
concluded without incident.

December
--------

 The first half of
December saw life returning to normal for most of the world's
inhabitants. With a new emperor on the throne of the largest nation in
the universe, the uncertainty that had plagued many people's lives over
the last few months had abated and the economy had re-stabilized itself.
Doriam Kor-Azor had begun his rule, and was already making waves in the
interstellar political arena with moves that analysts touted as "just
good politics, plain and simple." One notable incident concerned the
fleet of now-headless superpower House Sarum; on the 11th of the month
several squadrons massed at [Sarum Prime](uO7T7UMc6L0S8OUcHJJqP),
prompting CONCORD to increase their own presence in the system, bumping
it up to a new level of security. At first speculations ran rampant
regarding what the Sarum fleet was up to with this massive consolidation
of forces, but no indication has been given of any movement from Sarum
Prime as of yet.

In the latter half of December, we experienced the beginning of what may
be the greatest technological leap of the decade when the Crielere
project's technological advances were unveiled and made freely available
to the public. The announcement came from [Otro Gariushi](5QydCJCoYvbvbWvFlAlbHg), the CEO of [Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI), amidst much public doubt
and speculation - why were the Gallente and the Caldari sharing the
results of their research so freely? Whatever the answer, the world's
nations haven't been resting on their laurels; a great deal of Minmatar
[Brutor](5xBrtZyeYfTxWkZTO1o5zg) have been overtly clamoring for a war
effort against the Amarr, reportedly confident that the new technology
gives them just the edge they needed to strike at the heart of the
giant. The [Sebiestor Tribe](1fNour0sFTIcCFRVQM2pro), however,
haven't been quite so quick on the trigger and have tried their best to
tone down their brothers' rough-hewn rhetoric. Nevertheless, the rumor
mill churns away merrily with all sorts of tales of underground war
efforts being supported by high-ranking government agencies within the
Minmatar Republic.
