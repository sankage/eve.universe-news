**Johan Serris** is a middle-aged resource inspector for a [mining colony](6NQhah6uyVb1Bzg0ifUe5N). While searching for a water leak,
he visits [Atira Malkaanen](2Lx4cj34K3HsNZG7Wxq5dk)'s residence and
reluctantly asks if he can inspect it. He's dismayed to find wet clothes
in her shower, which he innocently assumes she has been washing there
instead of using the colony's industrial facilities. When he notices the
clothes are bloody, he accepts Atira's explanation that she had an
accident due to her period being early.
