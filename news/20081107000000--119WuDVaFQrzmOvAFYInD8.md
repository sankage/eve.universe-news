Molden Heath - The Republic Fleet is reported to be shifting naval forces to border systems with the Amarr Empire. This movement is believed to be in response to unannounced military exercises by Imperial Navy forces in the Tash-Murkon Region. Although no official statement has been issued by the Ministry of War, the Republic Fleet appears to be gearing for a direct assault on its sovereignty.

Analysts report that the redeployment of naval assets to key strategic points is standard operating procedure for this kind of development.
