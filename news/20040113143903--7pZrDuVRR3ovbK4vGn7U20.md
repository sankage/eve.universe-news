President Foiritan of the Gallente Federation recently made an unexpected visit to the Crielere research labs. Touring the facility the President learnt of the recent theft of blueprints and prototype equipment and was absolutely livid at the news. Foiritan was far from happy with how the Crielere command responded to the theft and felt is smacked of a cover-up. He demanded that an independent investigation team be formed and given complete access to the labs, brushing aside the feeble protests of the chief researchers.   
  
The independent inquiry into the theft is now underway, working quickly to have a report ready in a few short days. Many are waiting anxiously for what might be found and it is believed that several high-ranking personnel of the facility have already handed in their resignation and gone into hiding.
