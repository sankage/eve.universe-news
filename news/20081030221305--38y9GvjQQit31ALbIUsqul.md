Aset - Several sources have within the last few hours independently reported a disaster at a Minmatar Republic asteroid mine in Aset.  There seems to have been a large seismic disturbance within the asteroid which caused the access shaft to collapse, trapping the mining crews within.

Details are still vague at this time. The Minmatar Mining Corporation, operator of the mine, which was located within the contested zone along the empire's border, has issued a brief statement saying that it has dispatched emergency teams directly to the site.

There have been no official estimates as to the numbers of workers trapped within the asteroid as of this time.
