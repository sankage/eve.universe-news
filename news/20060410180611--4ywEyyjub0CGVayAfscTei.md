DEKLEIN. The Imperial Republic Of the North has splintered, and will be leaving the Deklein region to regroup in Empire space.  
The [statement](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=319657) has been relayed by Darko1107, Co-CEO of EXODUS, Executor of the IRON alliance. In it, he explains the motivations and reasons behind the move, namely communication problems within the alliance, and disagreements concerning the Republic’s future as well as logistics problems in holding sovereignty in the region. 

As such, senior corporations EXODUS, Synergy. and InterGalactic Corp. have effectively terminated membership of the other corporations from the Republic. Citing indiscipline, low morale and an averted coup-d’état, they have, “moved out of Deklein, and left whatever entities existing there to form their own alliance and take the stations.”  
It will not, however, be flying free of all ties, as positive standings will be kept with former allies such as corporations from the G Alliance, RAZOR Alliance as well as other residents of the Fade and Deklein regions.  
When asked about their next step, Mr. Darko explained that they will be regrouping and reorganizing both on the corporation and alliance level, to then “pick a target, or targets, and attack them for as long as deemed fit.” 

For former IRON corporations, such as The Arrow Project or AUS Corporation, the move was surprising, but not unexpected, since discontent had been brooding in alliance ranks for a while.  
Their first priority is now to consolidate the territorial claim and station control, as well as “make sure that everyone that remains is taken care of,” as explained by 1naz, Executive Officer at ARROW. They are not alone in this task, since support has been flowing from neighbours as well as former alliance members; sources indicate that pilots have been returning to the region due to the new direction the political landscape has taken. 

It has now to be seen whether their next step will be the formation of an alliance to regroup Deklein resident corporations, or if some of the more influential corporations will be absorbed by the newly formed Dusk and Dawn alliance.  
Whatever the course of action, political relations will not be changing much, since the entity will be staying in the north-western power block. 

Commenting on the scission, Kep Ekatemi, political analyst from the University of Caille, thinks that “It was for the best interests of both seceding parties, effectively avoiding a civil war, which could have had disastrous consequences on their respective interests and goals.”  
According to him, this alternative is supplanting armed conflict in the resolution of leadership differences, as seen in the recent splintering of the Axiom Empire from the Ascendant Frontier.
