 **Jel** \- In a stunning move the board of EBank has announced the immediate removal of their current CEO, EBANK Ricdic. In a statement released not long ago they revealed he was being removed "for misconduct that can damage public confidence in EBANK".  
  
[![EBANK Ricdic](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3121/ebankricdicthumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eve-ic.net%2Fmedia%2Farticles%2F3121%2Febankricdic.png)The decision was reached after an "impromptu meeting" by the board, at which EBANK Athre was promoted to fill in as CEO on an interim basis until a more permanent solution could be agreed. This process was part of a contingency plan that had previously been devised, and now implemented.  
  
Meanwhile, EBANK customers cannot currently deposit new funds, a situation which apparently is set to continue for up to a week while the enterprise reorganises. Access to accounts remains, however, in all other regards.  
  
Aelisha, a customer of EBANK, had been expecting Ricdic's departure and was concerned how the information had leaked out: _"It's the fact that either a leak or a premeditated 'easing the transit' rumour got out from EBANK and it just seems a little unprofessional - when you're trusting people with money, trust is a big issue."_ When asked if she still feels safe leaving her ISK with EBANK, she commented _"I do not at the moment, but I also have faint hopes that it will see a shake up and the return of higher interest accounts to stimulate existing customers."_  
  
Ji Sama of Sex Drugs And Rock'N'Roll, however, continues to have faith in the organization: _"Thank you EBANK, you still have my trust... Athre is upstanding and would never steal from anyone."_  
  
The bank still continues to honour all withdrawals against monies they received prior to Ricdic's misconduct.  
  
The Interstellar Correspondents will bring you further updates from EBANK as they become available.
