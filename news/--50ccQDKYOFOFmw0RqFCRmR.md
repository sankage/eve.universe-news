# Aneutronic Fusion
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/aneutronic-fusion

**Aneutronic fusion** is a form of fusion power in which less than 1% of
the energy produced is neutrons; the overwhelming majority of the
released energy is charged particles (protons) that can be converted
directly into electricity.

Any reference to 'fusion' in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk)
as a power generation source is referring to aneutronic fusion.
Conventional fusion technology still exists in New Eden, but is used
mostly for weapons applications.
