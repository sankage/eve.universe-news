# Ersilia Kor-Azor
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/ersilia-kor-azor

**Ersilia Kor-Azor** is the daughter of [Doriam II](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT)'s
sister Sabin. She is a cousin of [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV), 
and his confirmed successor as
Kor-Azor [Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh).

Life
----

She grew up at the [Kor-Azor Family](1S0FEGgzJiwc4yXaG5AzjD) court,
and Ersilia's uncle Doriam, later to be Emperor Doriam II, personally
oversaw her education, wanting her to receive the same instruction as
his son Aritcio. Soon Ersilia proved herself a keener intellect and
better student than Aritcio, whose envy led him to persecute her. Well
educated in loyalty to the Family and to its precepts, Ersilia endured
Aritcio's rivalry and outright scorn for years, until in her twenties
she asked her uncle Doriam for permission to leave the court and serve
the House elsewhere. Although free to express her true potential when
this request was granted, she had effectively removed herself from
Doriam's immediate circle. In later years, Ersilia appears to have
believed Doriam might have seen in her a better successor than Aritcio
if she had stayed.

Working in the outer reaches of House Kor-Azor's business and diplomatic
sphere, she became a renowned negotiator, and a proud, resilient person.
She is polite and calm, seldom lighthearted even in private, and gives
the impression of a rather serious, somewhat humorless character.
However she is never cruel, even while taking tough decisions, and is
generally considered a godly person and good leader.

Even with her qualities, she became widely notorious while she was
working on secondment to the [Ministry of Assessment](79mGvIq3LHSJ3KiUPcd46v)
during the [Girani-Fa incident](2UHBIYTHWxi6ePMtEEAOZw). As the head negotiator for the
Amarr Empire, she proposed the involvement of [Quafe](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6)
as a means to break the dangerous deadlock over the Girani-Fa system.
Her consequent fame and increased standing brought Aritcio's envious
attention on her again. He was able to convince his father to arrange
her marriage for political gain to a powerful Holder ruling the capital
planet of the Nimedaz constellation. While the marriage actually gave
Ersilia considerable influence over a major planetary holding, the
overall effect was isolating and constituted a defining moment that
robbed her of many opportunities she had previously earned. By his
meddling, Aritcio made an enemy of her for life. In reaction to her
isolation, Ersilia started to pursue fame and power to one end only: to
be her uncle Doriam's preferred successor.

Before the [Succession Trials](3yGFKyRmrZRaTtTGOLkRzU)
that made him Emperor, Doriam chose Aritcio to succeed him, and Ersilia
began planning to depose and kill her cousin. After Doriam's death, she
had to rush her plans: the new Succession Trials might have been called
at any time, and she couldn't risk Aritcio becoming Emperor. Ersilia had
become convinced that the erratic Aritcio was a madman and all Amarr
would suffer greatly under his rule. Moreover, it was almost certain
that she would be summoned to be part of the [Emperor Family](IXrotYvoWOVnuGAMbbYEv)
if Aritcio ascended the throne.

Aritcio's rule as Royal Heir of House Kor-Azor had been so capricious
that serious unrest had developed. Ersilia began to covertly support
aggrieved Holders within the Kor-Azor territories, even going so far as
to secretly aid those opposing Aritcio during the Liparer II crisis
, hoping that it would weaken Aritcio's grasp on power. In the
event, other factions within the Kor-Azor Holders called on the Speakers
of Truth and when [Brother Joshua](3GdUiafeRMQKdpzDb8CWnJ) of that
order became involved matters developed otherwise .

During Aritcio's convalescence she worked hard to stabilize the region,
and before he fully recovered from his punishment, she had done much to
make her name and deeds known. When her cousin came back to public life,
he unexpectedly thanked her for her work more than once, increasing her
fame within the Kor-Azor holdings and across the Amarr Empire.

Cooperation with Aritcio
------------------------

Never truly believing in Aritcio's redemption, Ersilia was careful to
cultivate her personal power and influence in the Kor-Azor family during
Empress Jamyl's reign. In this regard, Ersilia finally received direct
and tangible gains from her arranged marriage upon the death of her
husband, inheriting control of his personal holdings in YC112. She was
surprised when, just before his appointment as
[Imperial Chancellor](7GOV3morIu47J3BmidrhU8), Aritcio asked her to be his
personal advisor on the affairs of House Kor-Azor. Suspicious beyond
reason but intrigued she accepted, with the plan of enforcing her power
and potentially fining a way to oust Aritcio. She never truly abandoned
this intention, but working closely with Aritcio she witnessed that he
had really changed, though her concern was that this change was
ultimately a result of deep and intricate psychological trauma.

Royal Heir-elect
----------------

After Jamyl's death, Aritcio declared at a Kor-Azor family council that
he was ready to withstand the Trials of Succession, and that he had
chosen Ersilia to be his successor. He made clear that her resolve to
rule was no smaller than her ability to do so, and she would be a
perfect Royal Heir for the Kor-Azor. While somewhat baffled, Ersilia
accepted and the family confirmed her as Royal Heir-elect ahead of the
trials for the Imperial Succession YC118.
