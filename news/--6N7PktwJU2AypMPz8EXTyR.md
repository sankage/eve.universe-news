The Syndicate region has only one system with a name - Poitot.

Early History
----------

In the decades that followed first contact with the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK), the [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn) were quick to take to the stars, reaching out to neighboring systems and establishing colonies.

Shortly before the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) secession from the Gallente Federation, and the war that followed, the Intaki began to move into a new region of space which had previously been left unexplored. The growing network of jump gates was expanded into the region, and the first pioneers began to establish planetary settlements in the star systems they had reached.

The Intaki named the first constellation they reached “Poitot”, in honor of the notable Idama and astronomer Isana en Poitot who had been the first to comprehensively chart those stars and constellations in the night sky.

War and Reprisals
----------

Later, during the [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV), the development of frontier colonies stalled, and the small Poitot settlements were largely forgotten.

In Placid, some Intaki called out against the conflict, or joined the Caldari in their fight against the Gallente, while others called for their own independence from the Federation.

The mixed outcry would later become known as the Intaki Uprising, and it did not go unpunished by the Gallente Federation.

In the final years of the Gallente-Caldari War,  the Ultra-Nationalist government began to turn its attention inwards, with a view to deal with those who had spoken out. Reprisals were swift and severe.

President Duvalier ordered the arrest of thousands, labelling them political dissidents and a risk to the stability of the post-war Federation. Peaceful activists were rounded up alongside separatist rebels and violent criminals alike.

Duvalier wanted them all to disappear, but was reluctant to execute them and turn them into martyrs. Instead, he planned for the detainees to be removed from sight and exiled to the fringes of the Federation. He selected the bordering systems of the Poitot constellation as their destination.

A small Navy task force was sent ahead of the exile fleet with orders to raze every settlement to the ground, condemning the prisoners aboard their own ships.

Shortly after the Navy had jumped back to Placid, explosions rocked the jump gate's superstructure causing irreparable damage.

Duvalier's final act of spite had been to order the sabotage of the constellation jump gate to the Intaki system. The gate on the Placid side was slowly redirected, effectively slamming the door behind the exiles' backs. The Federation redrew the galactic map and deleted the names of the constellation and its colonies from the records.

Rebuilding
----------

Beyond the Federal border and out of sight, the exiled flotilla of repurposed cargo haulers, civilian shuttles and surviving colonist prospecting ships gathered at the jump gate wreckage. Over time the ruined structure began to disappear as it was taken apart and salvaged. The largest surviving section of the structure was relocated to the fifth planet, where it became the core of the first free station, of what would later develop into the [Intaki Syndicate](5aCxBhwo0vxK42kDWY4vKJ).

As the exiles built their new home in space, they renamed the system Poitot, in memory of the first constellation colonies they had lost.

Such was its significance, they would not name another system in the region.

Present Day
----------

Two major Syndicate organisations have their corporate headquarters in the Poitot system.

The Intaki Syndicate corporation offices are found aboard the the bureau station run by the infamous [en-Diabel family](4BJ0d6egqu6OsvXHQ0ah5u). Close by, the Intaki Space Police headquarters also act as an assembly plant, ensuring their forces are constantly supplied with new ships and equipment.

The presence of these two important stations, and the system’s historical significance, means Poitot is the de facto capital system of the Intaki Syndicate.

Trivia
----------

Poitot is the only named system in The Syndicate.
