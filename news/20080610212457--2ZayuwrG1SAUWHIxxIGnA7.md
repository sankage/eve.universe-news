The confusion of Matari across the Republic rose to new heights as rumours of Ammatar Consulate Governor Ana Utulf’s urgings to defect filtered across the cluster. Expecting a bloody confrontation with the Ammatar to free their once-lost tribe, there was widespread shock as reports stated an overwhelming lack of resistance.

"I can’t believe it," said Bhane Karemi, one of the many hundreds of thousands of Matari now filling the streets of cities across the Republic. "I can’t say I trust these reports, and I bet I’m not alone in that. They’re probably buying time until the Amarr arrive.." Reactions to the invasion remain mixed, confusion still reigns about the composition of the force, and no one seems to have any idea who’s leading the fleet. Some are already celebrating what they see as the return of their people and others simply confused as they watch news feeds eagerly for more information.
