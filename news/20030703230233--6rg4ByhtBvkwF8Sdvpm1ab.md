In an emergency meeting convened at the Secure Commerce Committee's Headquarters today, committee delegates from each of the empires have agreed that all publicly rented manufacturing and research slots in stations that come under SCC legislation (effectively, most of the stations in the known universe) will have their leases cancelled if it is found that the facilities are not being put to use during the rental period. The stated purpose for this new agreement is "to further encourage the growth of industrial competition in order to strengthen the galactic economy."   
  
The SCC has put plans in motion to appoint specialized inspectors at each station who will monitor the facilities in order to ensure that station resources are not being put to waste while, as an anonymous delegate put it, "the smaller entrepreneurs, the life-blood of a healthy economy, are left in the cold."
