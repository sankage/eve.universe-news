## Origins

*I have always found it remarkable that despite the vastness and breadth of this universe, we are all fundamentally so much the same—capable of such deep and genuine love for our nearest, and such astounding cruelty to those on the other side of whatever divide we choose to carve out next to ourselves. We make art of such beauty that it blinds the eye, and wage wars of such ugliness that they blind the soul.*

*Every place thus far inhabited by our species has been fractured by veins of discord, ultimately crumbling beneath the weight of our hatred. And yet, through a combination of blind providence and technological progress, we continually find new havens to sustain us. New Eden is mankind’s latest such garden, one more chance to light the dark of space with motes of hopeful civilization. Would that we could dream it won’t be our last.*
