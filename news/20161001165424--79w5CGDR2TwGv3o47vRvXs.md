Welcome to the Alliance Tournament Team Spotlight, where we take a closer look at some of the teams competing in the [Alliance Tournament XIV](https://community.eveonline.com/community/alliance-tournament/). Today, we are shining the spotlight on [404 Alliance Not Found](https://gate.eveonline.com/Alliance/404%20Alliance%20Not%20Found) [U-WOT], who also participated in last year's Alliance Tournament XIII.

Although this is only the second time 404 Alliance Not Found has fielded an Alliance Tournament team, several of their members have been in previous Tournaments multiple times with other alliances.

In YC117, 404 Alliance Not Found were defeated in both their matches, by Vox Populi. in the first, and Drop the Hammer in the second. According to team member [Heimotz](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Heimotz), they were "curbstomped, but it was still a lot of fun. Both matches we were countered and wrecked, we did fine, the other teams just crushed us. We picked Paper, they picked Scissors." He went on to say, however, that "our goal last year was fun, this year the same goal. We had fun last year, and will have more fun this year."

We asked Heimatz about his opinion of their chances. "To win it all? Nil. At some point wealth and size give teams a real advantage. We're very small, and use a lot of our time on corporation matters, can't dedicate a lot of time to making many comps and practice. We don't own any AT ships to pull out, and our budget for flagship is laughably low. Still, advancing in the brackets isn't out of the question, and it's just more fun to have!"
