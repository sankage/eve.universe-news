 **TAMA - The Citadel** \- In the early hours of 1st August eight mothership class vessels representing the four main races of New Eden entered the Tama system with the intention of destroying as many Caldari Milita forces as possible.    
  
Early reports are telling us that of the eight motherships only two made it out, as the Channel 4 News Team forces were engaged not by Caldari militia pilots but by pilots from the Cry Havoc. alliance.  
  
Full loses are still to be confirmed and a full report will be published once they have been established.
