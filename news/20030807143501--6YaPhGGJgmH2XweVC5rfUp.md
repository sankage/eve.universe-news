The controversy over the recent Aidonis award continues as news of increase in Minmatar rebel activity has started flowing in. Amarr and Minmatar authorities have expressed concern over this development, which is believed to have been sparked directly by awarding the Amarr Emperor the coveted peace-prize. Minmatar rebels fighting to free people enslaved by the Amarrians feel this is a harsh message that goes close to condoning slavery. Their response has been to send dozens of raids into Amarr space to increase public awareness for their cause.
