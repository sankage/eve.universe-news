### Sanmatar Joins Geffur Voluval as Republic Celebrates Crisis Victories

Clans throughout the Republic have resumed Voluval after a surge of Minmatar Crisis victories. The reinstatement of these sacred rituals represents a growing confidence in the Republic’s ability to deal with the ongoing Drifter Crisis. 

Minmatar forces were caught off-guard when the Crisis began, and found themselves unprepared for Drifter strikes. Since then, the Republic has managed to swiftly reorganize and become the most effective anti-Drifter force. Thanks to this ability to pivot and capsuleer efforts, the Matari have now claimed victory in 18 systems, the most of any nation. 

Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor joined celebrants on the barren world of Geffur V, where a clan of carbon-harvesters held their first Voluval since the Drifter Crisis began. Drifter forces have attacked Geffur twice, and twice capsuleers have defeated them.

“I am proud to stand with the clans of Geffur,” Shakor told those partaking in the Voluval, “and honored to witness the rites performed by these young people today. The perseverance of this noble clan is no small thing. You have all shown your resilience time and time again. All Matari are with you today, as you are joined with them forever.”

### SOCT Telemetry Gives Rise to Fears Over Tabbetzur

While the Minmatar celebrate, the Society of Conscious Thought has registered a continuing rise in hyperspace traffic around the Republic system of Tabbetzur. The rise coincides with the Minmatar’s surge in Crisis victories. Society scientists hypothesis that the shift in activity will reach its peak next week, on the 6th of March.

Republic forces have already begun coordinating evacuation efforts in Tabbetzur. Republic Fleet Admiral Kasorata Fogneko told reporters, “We have learned the lessons of the early Crisis, and of Turnur. The people of the Republic are our number one priority.”

As the exact nature of the coming threat remains unclear, many Tabbetzur-based clans have elected to stay. Brutor Tribal Chief Wkumi Pol has called for the Republic to “forcibly evacuate at-risk individuals” should their clans refuse to leave, stating that “Survival is the first step in the road to victory”. Sebiestor Chief Acassa Midular criticized this suggestion, voicing her position that “it is the tribes and their clans, not the Republic, that should decide their peoples' fates.”

“Whatever comes on the 6th, fleeing will not bring us closer to victory” she continued. “The Deathless Circle started this Crisis with their thoughtless experimentation on Jovian technology. Our only path to victory is to claim that power and that knowledge for ourselves. Only then will we have what we need to push the Drifters back, and strike at the heart of their operations.”
