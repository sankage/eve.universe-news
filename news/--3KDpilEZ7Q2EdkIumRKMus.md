# Vitor Dranera
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/vitor-dranera

Vitor Dranera is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) torturer.

He is very familiar with numerous methods of torture and derives some
amount of pleasure from describing the various methods to captives.
Vitor, who is described as a wizened old man, has overseen the torture
of several [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) secret agents who attempted
to infiltrate the Empire. He appears to be in charge of his facility, as
he threatened a technician and used one prisoner to see why his
equipment was being escaped. Two instruments he favors are the [Sin Eater](794wlFxb2YGdWeorXlrw9P) and the [Holy Star](5O5B2bkCF6R0eO3ZkumPCz).
