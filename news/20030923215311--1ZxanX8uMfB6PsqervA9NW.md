Greetings, everyone. My name is Iece Quaan. I'd like to introduce myself as one of the new Interstellar Correspondents for the Domain region. CONCORD, through a rigorous submission process, has selected seven correspondents from around the galaxy to bring local news to the populace of EVE. I am very happy to have been chosen to be a part of this program. I will be reporting on anything and everything. Events, rumors, corporate policies, anything that catches my attention. I do not intend to cater to any one type of news item, but to be more of a reporter based on my personal interests. If it interests me, then my feeling is that it might interest someone else, and would therefore be newsworthy. I look forward to bringing you some interesting tidbits in the weeks and months to come. See you later!
