Rodj Blake of PIE Inc. [PIE] has announced that his corporation is sponsoring the Amarrian Loyalist of the Year awards and that nominations are still open.  
  
According to Rodj Blake there will be two awards given, the first, Amarrian Capsuleer of the Year, will be presented "to the Amarrian, Khanid or Ni-Kunni pod pilot deemed to have achieved the most on behalf of the Empire during the last twelve months."  
  
The second award, Loyal Servant of the Year, is to be presented "to the non-Amarrian pod pilot deemed to have furthered the aims of the Empire the most during the last twelve months."  
  
Winners of the awards will receive Amarr faction ships, a Navy-Issue Apoclaypse-class battleship for the Amarrian Capsuleer of the Year, and a Navy-Issue Omen-class cruiser for the Loyal Servant of the Year.  
  
While there have been many nominations so far, the process has been somewhat fractious, with Grr of Epitoth Guard [E.G.] ,Curatores Veritatis Alliance [CVA] claiming that last year "saw a pirate awarded the title Amarr Loyalist of the Year." Grr further adds "I urge the voting this year to consider last year's mistakes and vote a true loyalist."
