# Sarum Prime
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/sarum-prime

Sarum Prime is the capital system of the [Sarum Family](4EZ4a3Mw8QXHmisAA4Ff6L).
It is in the Domain region and, at a
single jump from the Amarr system, is (along with [Kor-Azor Prime](62Qsy38P0XnR1c2JhWHzFq))
the closest of the
[Heirs'](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) capital systems to the
[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) homeworld. The system contains seven planets;
three temperate, one gas giant, one lava, one storm, and one barren. It
is a system of major importance in the Empire.

Discovery and Exploration
-------------------------

The Sarum system has been known by the Amarr since ancient times. The
system's star is dimly visible from [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4) without the need for a telescope. For
thousands of years, the star has been considered the star of the Sarum
house. Around three-thousand years ago, the star underwent a brief
period of increased luminosity which made it brighter in the sky for
roughly a year. This increased brightness coincided with a series of
good fortune for the Sarum Family, which took the star to be an omen of
good luck.

Because the system is physically distant from the seat of the Amarr
Empire, it took some time after the rediscovery of [jump gates](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) for Amarr explorers to reach the system.
Because the Sarum Family desired its exploration and colonization,
however, they pressed for a speedy expedition. The first explorers that
arrived were loyal to the Sarum Family and reported a system with a
stunning three planets capable of housing human life.

The Sarum Family quickly petitioned the [Council of Apostles](nTZLcvZprqLLUiGIaVQu7) for authority over the system,
which was granted. The family immediately claimed the third planet as
their capital and began colonizing it. From there, they slowly spread
their power over the entire system and eventually put large cities on
all three terrestrial worlds, as well as smaller habitations on the
others for scientific and economic purposes.

Until YC 105, the system was considered a low-security system by
[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt). When [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) committed
[Shathol'Syn](7uCmeRGL3bgVWlEWQ9TZQb) following the coronation of
[Doriam II](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT), Sarum Family security forces massed
in the system and it was reclassified as a high-security system shortly
after.

Sun
---

The system's sun, known as "Sarum's Star", is an old class M0 V red
dwarf star. It has a surface temperature of 3124 K and an equatorial
radius of 412000 km. Despite being an aged star, because of its spectral
class, it is expected to remain stable for many billions of years.

Roughly three-thousand years ago, the star underwent a brief period of
increased luminosity. The increase in luminosity lasted for roughly one
year. Such sudden changed in luminosity are extremely rare in red dwarf
stars and there is no evidence the star will be entering a similar
period again. The geological record on all three temperate planets
indicate mass extinctions occurring during this short period. The causes
for this sudden increase in luminosity remain unexplained, though
numerous theories have been advanced.

Inner Planets
-------------

### Sarum Prime I

The first planet in the system is a small lava world. It is tidally
locked with Sarum's Star, so that one side always faces the sun. Despite
this, the planet has enough of an atmosphere to keep the entire surface
superheated. Because of the extreme temperatures of the world, it was
the last in the system to be inhabited and exploited.

Today, the planet is primarily of scientific interest, with several
small research stations scattered around its surface. These stations are
permanently inhabited, though teams rotate out regularly. Additionally,
several planetary extraction sites are present, collecting the planet's
sparse resources, including base metals and suspended plasma.

### Sarum Prime II

A warm, small temperate planet, Sarum Prime II was initially deemed
unsuitable for colonization. It has a mean temperature of 300 K, with
highs at certain equatorial regions reaching 360 K. Much of the planet
is also quite humid, making it very uncomfortable for most human
habitation. Because it is so close to its sun, it has a very rapid
orbit, meaning it essentially has no seasonal variation as well.

However, after [Mekhios](3VOfvlm6gGI0LRutDj5MhI), Sarum Prime II was
considered the most viable to be colonized. It remains the second-most
populated planet in the system and is thus one of the more heavily
populated worlds in the Empire. The planet is primarily an agricultural
world, serving as the main source of grains for the Sarum system. It is
home to several varieties of Amarr wheat that take advantage of the heat
and high level of rainfall to grow rapidly and perpetually.

Prior to colonization, the planet had an advanced biosphere. Human
colonization has pushed numerous land species to extinction, while many
more exist almost solely in zoos and private collections. The planet's
rich oceans are home to a variety of aquatic species, several of which
are commercially fished.

During the Elder War, the planet was targeted by Insorum bombardment.
The damage was quickly contained, however, due to the intervention of
Jamyl Sarum.

### Mekhios (Sarum Prime III)

Mekhios, named after the founder of the Sarum Family, was the first
planet colonized in the system. It has an unusual atmospheric
composition which leaves it appearing almost metallic from space, with
silvery oceans and golden continents. This drew the Sarum Family to name
it their capital planet and colonize it.

On the mean, the planet is slightly warmer than the second planet by a
few degrees. However, the temperature variation is much wider across the
planet, the extreme highs are smaller, and it is much less humid, making
it far more comfortable for human habitation. The planet has a
relatively short orbital period, giving it two seasons; a hot, dry
summer and a warm, damp spring.

The planet, as the capital of the Sarum Family, is one of the most
populated in the Empire. Today, the planet serves primarily as a tourist
and trade hub, a place where the rich and affluent of the cluster can
buy high-priced Amarr goods, see elaborate Amarr operas, and view famed
works of art. Several prominent artists call Mekhios their home.

The planet's biosphere was very advanced and was home to several
sub-sapient species that scientists believe may have one day evolved
intelligence if allowed a few more million years of development. Because
the planet has not been developed as an industrial or agricultural world
as much as Sarum Prime II, the ecology has remained healthy and mostly
stable, though some unavoidable extinctions occurred.

On June 10th, YC 110, the [Battle of Mekhios](5rEhukOVHPitanB5Cn5jvd) occurred in orbit around the
planet while [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) troops assaulted the
surface freeing slaves. Due to the counter attack orchestrated by
Jamyl Sarum, the initial damage was contained, though still great.
However, the battle left large amounts of debris in orbit around the
planet. Much of it remains in a seemingly-stable orbit today, though
some entered the atmosphere and caused widespread destruction.

Outer Planets
-------------

### Sarum Prime IV

A small, cold gas giant, Sarum Prime IV is the primary source of noble
gasses in the system. It is particularly used in the harvesting of
Helium-3 for fusion reactions. Unlike many gas giants, the planet is
dully colored, being mostly shades of gray, though it has some
salmon-coloration at the poles.

The planet is small for a gas giant and is of some scientific interest
because of that. Several research stations exist floating in the upper
atmosphere to monitor the planet. These are mostly uninhabited, though
they contain the resources to support a small team for up to a month at
a time. The planet's gas harvesting plants are lightly staffed, as much
of their processes are automated.

### Sarum Prime V

Cool and stormy, Sarum Prime V is covered in a thick, turbulent
atmosphere. Despite this, the planet is home to several shielded cities,
though it is not as heavily populated as the temperate planets in the
system. These cities have primarily sprouted up around rich deposits of
metals and other valuable compounds, serving as support to mining
corporations that extract these resources.

Inhabitants rarely see direct sunlight due to the thick cloud cover,
though flashes of atmospheric lightning can brighten the sky for hours
at a time during the ever-present storms. This has caused many visitors
to become ill after a few days, due to disrupted sleep and biorhythm
patterns.

The planet has a fairly diverse, if primitive, biosphere consisting
mainly of microbial organisms that subsist off energy created by the
storms. It seems unlikely that any multi-cellular life would have
developed, however.

### Sarum Prime VI

Straddling the line between a terrestrial and an ocean world, Sarum
Prime VI lacks any large land masses. Instead, it is dominated by large
seas dotted with small continents and archipelagos. Because of this, the
planet's population is limited. Much of the land is inhabited, and
several underwater cities exist, but it is a distant third in population
to the other two temperate planets in the system and does not rank
highly on the population list of planets in the Empire.

The planet's main industry is fishing, as the oceans are home to
numerous aquatic species. While many of these are fished for
consumption, several have important medical uses as well. One species of
mollusc excretes as toxin that can be refined into a powerful pain
killer.

Notably, the planet has 21 moons, a rarity for a terrestrial planet. The
moons range in size from asteroid-sized (Moon 5, with a 173 km radius)
to larger than some planets (Moon 16, with a 3968 km radius). The
interactions of these moons cause for highly complex tides.

### Sarum Prime VII

A barren planet at the outskirts of the system, Sarum Prime VII is an
uninteresting planet. It has some mineral wealth, which has attracted
some small mining colonies. Its orbit carries it far from the other
planets, making it unimportant for intra-system trade as well.
