# Aura
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/aura

**Aura** is the name of the most popular personality skin
for the onboard computer [AI](67UaJpJzvXXlhQc8a0GnWR) utilized in
[capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) ships. She serves numerous purposes,
such as guiding new capsuleers through their first hours as a fully
independent pod pilot and issuing warnings and handling docking
requests. Aura is voiced by Excena Foer, a
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) entertainer and poet. Her
personality is noted for being dry and slightly black-humored, earning
her the affection of the capsuleer class.

History
-------

When the capsule and clone were married in [YC 105](7fPQjSvh0UicNGNdh3nVkd), early entrepreneurs realized that it would
lead to a rush of eager applicants hoping to achieve virtual immortality
through the [clone](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o). These pilots, fresh out of the
academies, would need someone to guide them through the early stages of
their careers. AIs that assisted with mundane ship operations were
commonplace, though they tended to run in the background and had no
obvious interface for non-pod pilots.

Early trials with AIs specifically designed to deal with pod pilots were
resounding failures. They attempted to interface with the pilot
directly, much as the pilot interfaced with his ship. This frequently
lead to confusion, headaches, and even bouts of paranoia. The solution
was to take a technological step backward, replacing the direct
interface with a voice which spoke to the pilot instead of attempting to
manipulate his brainwaves.

Capsuleers responded much better to the voice. The only question left
was what the voice should sound like. A strong, male
[Brutor](brutor) voice was suggested by some, thinking it
would help keep capsuleers in line, while others favored a subservient
female [Achura](4zhtMkBDe0W8xX2ihsfnik) voice as properly kowtowing to pod
pilot megalomania. Focus groups hated both; the Brutor was considered
"abrasive" and "harsh" while the Achura was "meek" and "prissy".

Many other ideas were floated, until some forgotten executive suggested
Excena Foer. Excena had lost her voice years before during an attempt on
her life, but had installed a risky voice box which she mastered in
record time. The voice box left her with a striking voice, characterized
by a slightly metallic distortion. She was brought in for an audition
and quickly surpassed expectations, giving a reading that was parts dry,
slightly condescending, and mildly humored.

Excena was hired and immediately began to record voiceovers for the AI.
Capsuleers responded to it favorably, and though additional voice and
personality skins have since been developed, Aura remains popular almost
beyond measure, being found in nearly ever capsuleer ship active today.
Every so often, Excena needs to record new lines as the AI is updated,
giving her a steady source of pay and powerful fans.

Technology
----------

Aura is a weak AI, meaning she is capable of carrying out tasks on her
own, though not learning or adapting to fit new parameters without a
software upgrade. Her primary task is guiding new pod pilots through
their first few hours and days as a licensed capsuleer, for which she
has an extensive database of knowledge and suggestions. However, she
also is responsible for monitoring a capsuleer's armor and shields and
warning them when they get below a certain threshold, arranging for
docking permissions with space stations, initializing
[warp](7o1BhmhKqoA32WfmkW8Yqt) and informing the pilot when the drive is
active, along with several other tasks.

She appears to a capsuleer both visually and aurally. Her voice is the
thing most capsuleers recognize, as it is piped into their ears through
speakers in their pod helmet. She can also appear as a
[hologram](3R2yaSdkUb08ifof3FfTZd) before their eyes, though because
of the nature of pod piloting, this is less noticed. Much like her
voice, she shares her appearance with Excena Foer, that of an attractive
Gallente woman in her early 30s. In order to assist with her perception
as an AI, Aura has a bald head covered in cybernetic implants as opposed
to Excena's ever-changing hairstyles and voice box. The hologram is
typically translucent blue, but depending on the projector, it may
appear as other colors.
