SEYLLIN 0936 - Fluid router traffic restored with Seyllin I has opened to a flood of distress signals originating from all four primary cities of the Federation planet. It is believed that the communications system was restarted autonomously following a self-imposed shutdown to protect itself from an external threat. Emergency channels have since been overwhelmed with distress calls, many with specific requests for an evacuation from the planet itself. There is no official word on the cause of this calamity or the extent of damage incurred. CONCORD and Federation vessels are reported to be scrambling towards the planet at this time.

This is a breaking news story. More information will be provided when available.
