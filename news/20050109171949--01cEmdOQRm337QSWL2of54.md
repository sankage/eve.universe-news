Arcane Technologies regretfully announced that they had to cancel their eagerly anticipated “Inter Alliance Industrial Cup” because of lack of interest. The Cup was scheduled for today.   
  
For all the hype and interest which this sparked, no teams decided to participate, leaving the organisers disappointed. However, that is nothing compared to the millions of extreme sports enthusiasts who were preparing for what they saw as the biggest sporting breakthrough since the mind clash and SplinterZ.   
  
However, some have pointed out that the cancellation is not entirely unexpected. The Curse Alliance has been losing members at an alarming rate; whilst the Fade Union has disbanded and the Northern Star and Phoenix alliances have been troubled by BoB, of which ATUK is a member.   
  
This still leaves a large number of alliances who did not register a team for this competition. Whether this has set a precedent for other such event failures in the future remains to be seen.
