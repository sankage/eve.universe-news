Experiments by the Jovian Navy on its new deep space stasis web project went terribly bad an hour ago. The galactic ramifications of this dangerous technology far exceeded the predictions of the Jovians. The result was a total stasis webbification of all ships in almost all regions of space. Representatives from the Jove Empire have refused to comment further on the experiment, leading to speculations about the future intent for the stasis web project.
