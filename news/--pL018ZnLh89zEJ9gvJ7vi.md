May, YC111
==========

Caldari and Intaki
-------------------------------------------------------------

Reaction to the appointment of Mens Reppola as
[Ishukone](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) CEO was cautious in the
Caldari markets, possibly due to the positioning of Ishukone in
opposition to Provist
policy by the new CEO. Caution was also evident in the reaction of
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) political and military figures,
welcoming the appointment as a possible opportunity to begin repairing
relations between the State and [the Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp).
External views notwithstanding, Reppola pressed on with asserting his
control over the megacorp and installed his close friend and navy
veteran Eborimi Shiskala as his successor in the [Ishukone Watch](21GQBhNgawJQQ39wqVX4yU) CEO post.

The effects of the Caldari occupation of the Intaki system continued to
be felt on Intaki Prime, as shortages of some high-end goods began to be
experienced on the planet. Public concern at the occupation among the
Intaki population was intensified by these shortages and the consequent
breakdowns and maintenance delays seen in the communications and
transportation infrastructure of the planet. While the planet was not
experiencing the food and essentials shortages seen in Verge Vendor
region, fear at the possible fate of the planet under Caldari occupation
remained high. Many wondered if the grim tales of the occupation on
Caldari Prime would be realized on Intaki Prime. Others suggested that
the Caldari would be hard-pressed to invade another heavily-populated
planet, with considerable planetary defense force presence, given the
ongoing occupation of Caldari Prime.

Empire, CONCORD and Caldari Victory
-----------------------------------

There was unexpected news from the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
towards the end of the month, as the [Royal Khanid 1st Fleet](nQJFwBFQzGij9cZKKCrm7) was reported crossing from the
[Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj) into the Tash-Murkon region
of the Empire. As the personal guard fleet of King [Khanid II](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf), it was known that the fleet always
accompanied the Khanid sovereign on any journey through space. The
speculation that Khanid II was visiting the Amarr Empire was proved to
be well-founded when he arrived in Tash-Murkon Prime and was met by
[Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) [Catiz Tash-Murkon](5sw0sEytwzlBUbKWdiisUI). As the first visit back to
imperial space of King Khanid II since his secession from the Amarr
Empire, it was clearly a significant moment in relations between the
Empire and Kingdom. The King remained in Tash-Murkon Prime for the
remainder of the month, evidently consulting with the Tash-Murkon Heir,
for whom this was clearly a diplomatic coup.

As [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) took the unusual step of issuing over
twenty additional licenses for high-level
[capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) liaison agents, due mainly to
profession and corporate demands, the continuing Caldari offensive
against the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) began to have severe impacts
on the Gallente economy. In particular, [Pend Insurance](3MEqbUgJsCwlfehyXJFrFN), a major Gallente insurance,
finance, and banking house, issued earnings warnings as the Caldari State
forces continued to score successes in Essence, Placid and Verge Vendor.
By the closing week of May, the Gallente navy and militia forces held
out in only four systems.

On the final day of the month, the last remaining system in the
CONCORD-mandated warzone in Gallente hands, Mercomesier, fell to the
Caldari [State Protectorate](2VlyV0CDyxFv0Qg3N3dW8k). The Caldari
State had achieved total victory and occupied all enemy systems while
maintaining control over all of its own systems.
