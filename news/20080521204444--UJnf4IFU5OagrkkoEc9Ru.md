**Into The West** \- Throughout the vastness of space, thousands of elite pilots fly across the starry skies oblivious of the forgotten wonders waiting to be rediscovered. 

Epic monuments, abandoned stations, crumbling ruins, weird and wonderful spacial phenomena, just some of the sights waiting to be seen. 

For those pilots who want to experience something different, for those who are wanting to capture the spirit of adventure and exploration, here is a collection of some of New Edens most important natural, man-made and other mysteriously fabricated landmarks and points of interest. 

Setting off from the remote port of Polaris we will travel in each of the cardinal directions documenting our finds. 

Since the start of the journey we have seen many things, now as we head in a western direction what will we find?

**Journeying Into The West**

__Cord Of The Elements__

  * As we start on this leg of our journey we discover that winding through the Syndicate region is a natural phenomenon that has baffled scientists for centuries. The phenomenon, a super-dense dark cloud, bends time in such a way that all space-travel in or close to the phenomenon is impossible, or at least extremely hazardous. Most scientists believe that the Cord is the remnant of collision between two black holes millions of years ago that permanently 'scarred' space. Others belief the Cord to be the result of a science experiment, possibly conducted by alien life forms, that went seriously awry eons ago. Needless to say we cannot travel close to the area so we will continue on.

__Trace Cosmos__

  * Our next stop finds us looking over the fields of Trace Cosmos. This area holds miniscule black holes and weird spatial rifts, making it much too dangerous to traverse. It is widely believed that the fields are the remnants of a massive collision between two galaxies millions of years ago. The colossal occurrence permanently altered the areas most affected, turning them into barren death traps.

__The Cauldron__

  * In the area simply known as The Cauldron, the remnants of several supernovas render the space unstable and treacherous. Filled with volatile gravity currents and large chunks of stellar debris the whole area is much too dangerous for space travel. The Cauldron lies between the Amarr Empire and the Khanid Kingdom and acts as a convenient natural barrier between the two hostile factions. It also has now stopped us proceeding in that direction, and although we are still unable to get any meaningful visual records, we have collected some interesting data we can study later. Our next stop is something we have been looking forward to for some time.

__The EVE Gate__

  * In the system of New Eden sits the impenetrable EVE Gate. Thousands of years ago the forefathers of all the human races used the gate to travel to the world of EVE. But the gate has been closed for a long time, a catastrophe that destroyed all planets in the New Eden system and plunged the fragile human settlements to the brink of extinction. Anyone foolish enough to get too close to the gate today will be ripped apart by the magnetic storms that still surround the massive gate. Despite the dangers in this area there are still signs that many like us have made this pilgrimage.
