**Fimiris** is the daughter of a Kor-Azor [Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) who is one of the sponsors of [Dr. Adad's Wild Time](6KzwIfSM44ZSJ2zYAQ7rWh). She is a huge fan of the show and has named one of her father's slaves after a cartoon character from it. When [Cherall](1rzSTLqlstsXunsk1zG2mB) met her, he made her promise to remember that the slave is a person and not a cartoon character, then gave her an autographed [holopad](6Ih40G42NoYPKinOtdIQQ3).
