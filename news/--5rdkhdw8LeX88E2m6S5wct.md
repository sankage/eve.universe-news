## Serpentis

The Serpentis Corporation is a cutting-edge research, development, and manufacturing corporation specializing in biochemistry and the production and distribution of high-technology pharmaceuticals. To put it more bluntly, Serpentis is one of the foremost manufacturers and smugglers of illegal drugs in New Eden. Concentrating primarily on the lucrative Gallente Federation market, Serpentis networks ship neural boosters and other drugs across the cluster in vast quantities every day. As a major source of illegal drugs and the crime associated with them, the Serpentis are high on the priority list of criminal organizations monitored by law enforcement in New Eden.

While Serpentis networks uncovered in the core empires are more or less readily dealt with by the authorities, the one advantage that the Serpentis Corporation holds over many other drug syndicates is its control of the Phoenix constellation of systems in the outer region of Fountain. Over the years, the Serpentis have established many subsidiary facilities and installations in neighboring regions and the hidden folds of deadspace. Their alliance with the Angel Cartel has brought them both additional security and a foothold in the Curse region, where they have many manufacturing and storage stations. From their well-protected bases in nullsec space, the Serpentis are able to control a large portion of the illegal booster market with little concern for the forces of law and order.
