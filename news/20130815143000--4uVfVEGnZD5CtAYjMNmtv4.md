The 8th [Council of Stellar Management](http://community.eveonline.com/community/csm/) (CSM8) will be holding its second Town Hall on August 17 at 1900 EVE time.  This is an excellent opportunity to speak with your elected representatives to CCP on matters that you feel are important in New Eden, particularly as they approach their first trip to Iceland the last week of August.  CSM8 is working in cooperation with EVE University and EVE Radio to provide an interactive session where you can listen, ask questions, learn about what the latest CSM is up to.

The focus of this particular Town Hall will be on the Summer Summit, suggestions for topics for us to take to this first CSM8/CCP Summit, the recent "Reasonable Things" player initiative, reactions to Odyssey 1.1, and of course, general questions from EVE players on any topic they desire.

The Town Hall will last for one hour.  Any interested player is invited to attend!  You can learn how to attend at [this thread](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=266431) on the EVE Online forums.  Hope to see you there!
