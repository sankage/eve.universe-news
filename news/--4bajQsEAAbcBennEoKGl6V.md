# Laser Pointers
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/laser-pointers

**Laser pointers** are small devices capable of emitting coherent
low-powered beams of visible light. They are often used for
presentations or personal amusement, though they can be dangerous when
used inappropriately. Most laser pointers emit red light, though all
colors of the spectrum are possible, with green and blue being the next
most common. The beams of the red lasers are often invisible except
where they strike a surface due to their small power, but other pointers
can emit visible beams due to photon scattering from the atmosphere.

Specialized Uses
----------------

### Holograph Presentations

Laser pointers are frequently used by corporations for presentations.
When combined with [holographic projectors](3R2yaSdkUb08ifof3FfTZd),
laser pointers can create highly colorful and interactive shows.
Specific portions of the holograph can be preprogrammed to change color
when intersected with the laser pointer. This is particularly useful for
military presentations, where objectives can be quickly highlighted.

### Holoscreen Interaction

Many recent models of holoscreens are equipped with laser pointer
interactivity, allowing users to remotely control their projectors
simply by pointing at it. The laser pointers can be used for anything
from changing the channel, highlighting a product in a holovid and
bringing it up on the market, or zooming in on a particularly
interesting background object.

This technology has been well-used in holovid games, where it allows for
a more interactive experience than a hand-held controller. While not as
engaging as full-sensation hookups, it is less costly and enables users
to pay attention to their surroundings while playing.

### Annoying Animals

Many species of animal find laser pointers either enthralling or
distressing. [Slaver hounds](4nmSv26geCZDYdQ8E5cVh9) often find
the tiny dots of red pointers to be fascinating and will chase the dots
as they are swept across a surface. Many [Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v)
have spent long hours entertaining themselves by using laser pointers to
convince their pet slavers to jump into walls. Thanks to the sturdy
nature of the creatures, they are usually unharmed by this. Of course,
enterprising slaves have also used this to effect escape, as
poorly-trained slavers will go after the first thing it sees, dot or
person.

Contrarily, [furriers](55Py0v5XOZySNC1oWsEV2O) are heavily annoyed by laser
pointers. When they see the dots, they often fly into rages and cause
heavy rackets. It can take them several minutes to calm down, even after
the pointer has been deactivated. Biologists believe this is an evolved
defense mechanism, with furriers mistaking the red dots for approaching
predators.

Dangers
-------

The danger of laser pointers are often overstated. The lasers emitted by
them are too low-power to be directly harmful, even when shined in the
eyes. While having a laser shined into the eye can cause temporary
blindness, it is of no greater permanency than looking directly into the
flash of a camera. If shined directly into the eye for a long period of
time, the damage can be semi-permanent, but in reality it is nearly
impossible for a person to voluntarily keep their eye open when such a
bright light is being shined into it.

The greater danger comes from pointers being shined into a person's face
to distract them while they are engaging in potentially hazardous
activities, such as during driving [planetary vehicles](4VDHQyfA7oKLZmtQ90lJNb).
Similarly, malicious pranksters can
often cause panic by shining the pointers at law enforcement, mimicking
the laser sights of some weapons.
