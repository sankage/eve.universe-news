THE FORGE. After learning the Caldari Navy’s intention to study the design of the Gurista Gila-class cruiser, a Caldari citizen has offered the blueprint at no cost.   
  
As reported [earlier this month](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=922&tid=6), Gurista strike forces destroyed a Gila-class cruiser that was to be studied by CalNav engineers. Caldari citizen Logan Xerxes [ offered through GalNet](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=236981) a free copy of the blueprint, at no cost to the State. “All for the good of many” declared Xerxes in his communication.   
  
Sources have reported that the CalNav is “seriously considering” the offer.
