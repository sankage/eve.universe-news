Concord announced earlier today that repairs and updates have been completed to sentry gun software and barring unforeseen issues, all sentries should now function as intended.   
  
In 0.6 space and above, sentries will monitor a range no less than 150 km from the object being guarded. However, Concord has boosted key sentries to have a much greater range. No details regarding maximum sentry range in secure space are to be made available to prevent outlaws from carrying out raids in secure space.   
  
In 0.5 space and below, sentries will have a maximum range of 150 km from the protected target.
