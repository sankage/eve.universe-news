**Atioth**, previously known as Vak'Atioth, is a solar system on the edge of [Jovian](5G7lpKcSSCEsTz7faQuIxt) space that contained several small research stations.

It was the site of the major battle of the [Amarr-Jove War](67yx5qBIGDtALlxjRjbwZr), known as the [Battle of Vak'Atioth](1Cq1o1feVsJi6HuaVZs1L4), where the [Amarr Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g) suffered a historic defeat to the highly mobile, more advanced Jovian fleet.
