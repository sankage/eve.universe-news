Earlier today Caldari Navy did a raid in Dantumi, leading the capture of the terrorist named Black Scarab. Miss Yaila Heeth, aka Black Scarab, had for several years been working disguised as a Caldari Navy courier, using her clearance to gain access to information and designs to be used against the Caldari Empire in acts of terrorism. She has earlier been under suspicions for espionage and a tip from an unknown source led to her capture while setting charges that would have disrupted gate travel out of the solar system Dantumi until repaired. She has now been moved to a secret location while waiting for prosecution.
