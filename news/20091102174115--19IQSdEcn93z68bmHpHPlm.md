 **Catch** , Ushra'Khan [UNITY], an alliance who describes themselves as "New Eden's oldest 'Freedom Fighters'", has announced that ownership of two Against All Authorities [.-A-.] stations has been transferred to their possession in the Catch region.  
  
UNITY a dedicated foe of the Amarrian "slavers", once fought for dominance of the Providence region, going head to head with the Curatores Veritatis Alliance [CVA], ultimately losing their two stations, "Unity Station" and "The Minmatar Outpost", to them. Since that time Ushra'Khan has resided in the Curse region marshalling its power for a return to Providence.  
  
The station transfers mark a historic moment for the alliance as described by Ugleb, CEO of Sarz'na Khumatari [SARZ] in a speech to the alliance. He says in part, "It has been over two years since the fall of Unity Station, the events of that battle took their toll upon us, and it took a long time, indeed, for us to recover from it" adding further that "for two years we have worked towards this day, and at last we arrive. We stand now stronger than ever before."  
  
It should be noted that the stations, one of which is in V2-VC2, the other in 5-N2EY, lay within easy striking distance of [CVA] assets.
