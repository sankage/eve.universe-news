Yulai - The Inner Circle Tribunal station orbiting Yulai VIII reported minutes ago that that a full evacuation has been completed, and that now only military personnel remain aboard the station. Several CONCORD shuttles have been spotted heading to an unknown location on the planet's surface, despite reports of vessels being engaged outside the station.

The status of the CONCORD Inner Circle has yet to be confirmed, although it is presumed that they have been transferred off the station along with all other civilian personnel.

As for the carnage at the CONCORD Bureau station, SOE ships are already on scene joining local CONCORD forces in a valiant attempt to rescue any survivors. No sighting of the Minmatar-Thukker task force has been made in Yulai since the attack.
