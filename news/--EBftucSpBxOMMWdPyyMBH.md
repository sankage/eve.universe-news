**Marlovian Joocasta** is a beloved entertainer possibly best known for
the [death](5WNhh1Tm9Ucm0ni1HgOotc) of his career. While popular in his
earlier years, his work tapered off as he aged. In an effort to combat
this he turned to [Vertan Nejowin](HXN0Wu61u9OaddvaouoRM) in the
early days of face-swapping. Some security procedures were skipped over
and some corners were cut with the result being Marlovian's face melting
off- literally.
