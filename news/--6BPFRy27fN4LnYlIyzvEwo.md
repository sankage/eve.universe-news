## Amarr Empire

The Amarr Empire is a rigidly stratified authoritarian imperial state ruled by the [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ). It is both the oldest and the largest of the empires of New Eden. This vast theocratic society is supported by a broad foundation of slave labor, mostly drawn from people of Minmatar extraction, but also from several other nationalities subdued by the empire throughout its long history. Their home planet in the Amarr star system was named Athra in ancient times, but was renamed [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4) during the expansion into space.

As a culture, Amarr adheres to the basic tenet that what others call slavery is in fact only one step on an indentured person’s spiritual path toward fully embracing the Amarr faith. Amarr citizens tend to be fervent and industrious individuals, deeply convinced from an early age of the moral superiority of their religion and the legacy of their favor in God’s eyes, a phenomenon that makes them quick to take whatever action they deem necessary in order to bring the unenlightened into the fold.

In its efforts to enforce this view, the empire has for centuries engaged in a campaign known as the Reclaiming, a holy war against unbelievers. The unfortunate losers of this war have historically been enslaved by the empire. Nominally, this slavery is designed to work off the sins of the non-Amarr until the day they will be free to enter Amarr society as enlightened followers. In practice, however, the holders—the general name given to the slave-owning gentry—usually pay mere lip service to this traditional duty, then go on to brutally work their slaves to death for profit.

Holders are privileged elites who control hundreds of thousands of lives each, given more or less free rein to rule commoners however they see fit. Some are capricious tyrants, while others rule with temperance and justice. Due to their sweeping powers within their respective domains and the archaic bureaucracy they are entrenched in, the political interplay between holders is not so much a finely woven web as a tangle of thread, with rivalries, political marriages, and insidious double deals forming an impenetrable knot of interests and intrigues.
