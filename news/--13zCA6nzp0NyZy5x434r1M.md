# Voluval
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/voluval

The Voluval is both one of the [Minmatar's](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) least understood, and most important rituals. Involving a specialized sort of [tattooing](5K88SAucdcLeQ07oEOROpy) process that marks the subject's body, the Voluval is a rite of passage practiced by nearly all sub\-clans of all tribes in the Republic. It is also known as the Test of Destiny and is the seminal event in a young Mimatar's life, representing their coming of age and official recognition as a member of the tribe.

Historical Background
---------------------

There have always been various ritualized rites of passage amongst the
Minmatar. While different rituals have been favored at different times
by different tribes, none has ever been so pervasive or wide-spread as
the Voluval.

It is believed that some of the earliest Minmatar rites of passage were
designed to test the subject, not so they could pass or fail, but to
identify what areas they may need help in as they moved into adulthood.
Some of the most barbaric and torturous rituals were designed for these
benign purposes. Later rites of passage began to develop towards a
physically easier curve, and as they did so, the negative associations
with failing the tests grew in significance. Initially, this resulted in
the subject of a 'bad' or 'failed' rite of passage being shunned by the
tribe or given distasteful jobs.

The Voluval was developed by Vherokior mystics during their time wandering the Greater Sobaki Desert. When
the Vherokior emerged from the desert around five thousand years ago and
began traveling in small caravans amongst the other tribes, the Voluval
spread with them. Tattoos were already such an important part of Tribal
life that the practice caught on quickly. Population pressures on Matar
soon saw the introduction of banishment with certain, rare, bad marks.

During the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) rule of the Minmatar, all cultural
tattoos were banned, and the secrets of the Voluval were thought lost.
When the Amarr yoke had been finally been thrown off, tattoos were one
of the first things to be returned to their place of cultural
importance. Even before the formation of the Republic, Vherokior mystics announced that they had
held on to the knowledge of the Voluval all through their long
subjugation. In a culture striving to re-establish its identity and
tribal roots, the resurrected ritual achieved an even greater
importance.

Now, in a curious parallel to how the ritual initially spread, Vherokior
mystics make regular trips to both the [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
and the Great Wildlands, in an effort to include the Gallente-Minmatar and the
Thukker in the practice. In the Republic,
many returning [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) and
[Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2) have also shown an inclination to fit in
by undergoing the ritual, even those that hold on to their Amarr faith.
While normally undergone in adolescence, exceptions are being made
regularly as the Republic opens its arms to its returning people.

Conversely, while the practice of the Voluval is growing in importance,
the significance of the marks themselves seems to be on the wane. Even
so, there are still those that experience harsh consequences for their
marks. Enforced vows of silence and banishment are still practiced,
though some families are now in a position to support those with bad
marks, and they simply disappear following an unfavorable outcome for
one of their kin.

The Voluval in Practice
-----------------------

### Process

The Voluval uses a special type of tattooing process, consisting of two
injections. One is an injection of tyrosine, the amino acid precursor to
melanin, and it is administered to the heart. The second injection,
delivered to the ventral root near the base of the spinal nerve, is a
formula known only to Vherokior mystics, and is a secret still closely
guarded by them even today.

A few decades ago, the Quafe company
investigated the possibility of using a similar form of tattooing as
part of an enhanced marketing strategy. The Quafe company sent a small
team of scientists to the Greater Sobaki Desert to gather flora and
fauna. They claimed great results using acetylcholine as a
neurotransmitter, along with oxytocin, calcitonin, and vasoactive
intestinal peptide hormones extracted from Sobaki Water-Root. Unable
to identify any further ingredients, nor willing to commit any more
resources to the venture, the project was shut down. There is evidence
to suggest the Amarr may have figured out the formula, but it is
circumstantial at best. 

Vherokior mystics have since confirmed the inclusion of Sobaki
Water-Root in the Voluval formula, saying it is simply one tooth of the
key to unlock one's Voluval tattoo. They believe the formula of the
second injection directs the subconscious to manipulate the melanin from
the first injection into forming a permanent tattoo. It is for this
reason Vherokior mystics insist proper mental preparation is a necessary
part of the Voluval.

### Preparation

Proper preparation for the Voluval ritual is of such importance that
those about to undergo it study for weeks. In the past, rituals were
performed individually, with each person having their own Mentor. Over
time, the Voluval came to be done in larger groups and the duties of the
Mentor were assumed by an Essence Instructor.

This job is usually handled by a local shaman and consists mostly of
relating legends, providing instruction in clearing the mind, and giving
advice and guidance. This is never more important than the day of the
Voluval itself, where it is common for the Essence Instructor to be
sequestered for up to six hours with those about to experience the
ritual. 

The Voluval can be done anywhere the tribe can gather, though the many
sacred sites on [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6) tend to host the largest ones.

### The Marking

Though the exact proceedings of the Voluval vary slightly depending on
circumstances, the main sequence of events remain the same. As the
leader of the ceremony, the Spirit Conductor's entrance signals the
commencement of the Voluval. Once the Spirit Conductor and their various
attendants have taken their place, the music starts. Adults in the crowd
who have already gone through the Voluval join the Spirit Conductor in
the singing of a traditional song. This is where the greatest deviation
among Voluval ceremonies occurs, as the song is often a local one,
though the musical accompaniment is usually provided by Singing Staffs.


One at a time, those being tested kneel before the Spirit Conductor, who
applies to their head an elixir meant to cleanse the spirit. As he
plunges the first injection directly into the heart, the Spirit
Conductor chants sacred words in a quiet prayer. The Spirit Conductor
then circles around behind the subject, and injects the second mixture
into the base of the spine.

At this point it is the participant's turn to speak. What is said is up
to the individual, though it was originally intended to be a declaration
of their outlook on life, themselves, or their surroundings. Over time
many sayings have become standardized amongst certain families and
sub-clans.

The Spirit Conductor places a black mantle around the subject's head and
shoulders as the injections begin to work. Within a few minutes, the
Voluval mark appears. The Spirit Conductor then removes the mantle, and
the mark is revealed to all.

After all the participants have their marks, the Spirit Conductor closes
the ceremony by leading a short group prayer. 

### Outcome

Most Voluval ceremonies end with the participants being welcomed and
recognized by the tribe. Nearly all marks tend to be benign, with some
even tending towards being hereditary, like the horned triangle of the
Graur family. [Karin Midular's](3KxlNVAeglPj5ZH0sf3U2j) mark, the Ray
of Matar, is the rarest and most auspicious of the Voluval marks. 

The rarest of the negative marks such as the Pale Eye, the Face of
Helina, or the Broken Shield can see its bearer out cast by the
Minmatar, banished to Arzad II. Less rare,
though still not common, are the other detrimental marks such as the
Spiraling Circle, the Scarecrow, the Purple Cross, or the Slaver's
Fang. These marks may force the bearer into a self-imposed, life-time
vow of silence, under traditional penalty of having their tongues cut
out should they ever break it. In recent years it has become common
for those with these marks to choose a life of exile over the burden of
bearing their shame amongst their kin.

The Voluval and Capsuleers
--------------------------

### Capsuleer Clones
Given that there are significant physiological differences between a baseline human's birth body and capsuleer clones, which are biological constructs, the physical processes involved in the ritual of evoking a voluval mark have a different range of effects to those seen when a standard human goes through the ritual. The effects are as variable but any marks produced are frequently quite different and seen as uninterpretable in the framework of the voluval ceremony. Put very simply, the traditional voluval often does not work properly on a capsuleer clone. There are believed to be radical variants of the process and ceremony that can reliably produce a traditional mark on an active clone, though this is the stuff of rumor, conjecture and, perhaps, unorthodox shamanic practice. 

When a Minmatar capsuleer's birth body is terminated, any voluval marking they may have can be effectively reproduced on a cellular level when their prepared capsuleer clone is sculpted. This is similar to reproduction of birth marks, freckles, scars, inked tattoos and other such marks as a capsuleer wishes to retain on their body according to their specifications. In the case of the voluval a similar level of cellular alteration is replicated but the cellular structures are essentially artifical and the replication is an artifice of the clone preparation process. While the mark is to visual inspection identical to the original, there are basic differences that can detected with the correct equipment.

Capsuleers can choose to dispense with skin marks, defects and scars as a simple change of specification when the clone is prepared. Relatively simple body-modding techniques can also achieve such alterations of an active capsuleer construct body without cloning taking place. This has a variety of implications when it comes to the voluval mark and different interpretations have generated several schools of thought on the matter.

### Cultural Attitudes
Related to this topic is the fact that in Minmatar society body- and mind-cloning are considered matters of deep personal ethics within the overall Matari traditional framework. Discussion of these things are not "taboo" in any strict sense but it is considered unseemly, to the point of infringing social ethics, to talk of the private cloning choices of another Matari in public, unless they themselves have openly spoken of it beforehand. Careless talk of private matters of this kind in front of non-Matari is considered a grave infringement of traditional ethics on a par with wearing an unearned ritual tattoo or tribal marking.

This aspect of Minmatar attitudes to cloning has important implications for non-capsuleers who avail themselves of cloning of one kind or another but, while still important to understand, certain of those potential implications are rendered moot by the simple fact that capsuleer status is a matter of public record. Even a first generation capsuleer, from the period when birth bodies were adapted for capsule pilot service, has always had to have a ready and prepared construct clone as a matter of legal requirement.

Even though the fact of having a clone body prepared is unavoidably a matter of public record, other related choices can be considered private unless openly shared. Included in this would normally be whether or not a non-facial voluval mark has been reproduced through cellular sculpting or not. This can be an important matter in some contexts. Opinions across Minmatar society vary on the legitimacy of reproducing voluval marks on capsuleer clones. The issue is necessarily a relatively recent one but certain strands of thought have emerged in the last century or so. 

### Traditional Perspectives
For some Matari traditions, and typically for the more conservative in the relevant traditions, the reproduction of a voluval mark can be seen as an affront to an aspect of Minmatar culture that was preserved despite the privations and horrors of the Amarr occupation. This viewpoint is respected as valid within the broad family of the Matari traditions and the framework of Minmatar tribal society but it is a minority view, even among those Minmatar who place great importance on the voluval mark.

The large majority of Minmatar who even stop to think about this matter are not so conservative in their attitudes. Most consider the reproduction of the voluval mark by cellular sculpting on a capsuleer clone to be essentially a matter of copying an outward sign of what was revealed by the evocation of the mark in an individual's voluval ceremony. As attitudes to the voluval in Matari society vary hugely, even within individual tribes, it is not a topic of general controversy that many Minmatar capsuleers copy their marks over to new clones.

There are moreover approaches to Matari spirituality and traditional practice that would consider it only sensible and proper to prepare a familiar physical form for a spirit crossing from a dying body to one in which it may fully live again. In these traditions, the manifestation of ultra-conservative thinking may occasionally verge on seeing a failure to reproduce the voluval mark as problematic. On the whole, though, these traditions of spiritualism, often being the most animistic of the Matari world views, are notably more relaxed than many other strands of thinking.
