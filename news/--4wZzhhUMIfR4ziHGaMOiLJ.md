# Amarr Island
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/amarr-island

**Amarr Island** is an island situated about 500 kilometers off the
coast of Assimia on [Amarr Prime's](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4) northern
hemisphere. The homeland of the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) people and
birthplace of the [Amarr Empire](3S8fg8x2gA9iWDupYhrNPt), the island
covers roughly 44400 square km. It has been populated since ancient
times. Originally home to numerous plains and forests, it is today
mostly covered by the Imperial capital,
[Dam-Torsad](UI6KVmdCZ0H42EvHijFVZ).

History
-------

### Early History

According to archeological records, Amarr Island was settled roughly
15000 years ago, around the time of the [EVE Gate's](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o) collapse. Few records of the time
remain, though according to the Amarr
[Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp), it was an act of divine providence
that brought them to the island while the rest of the universe suffered
from God's wrath. Records recovered from the mainland indicate that the
Amarr were forced to leave the mainland by other settlers; the exact
nature of their eviction is under historical debate. Pro-Amarr
historians claim it was a religious purge that force the Amarr off
Assimia, while opponents believe the Amarr failed in an early attempt at
conquest and were driven off.

In the beginning, the Amarr strove to keep their society unified.
However, as the centuries passed, the leaders of society began to
fracture and turn against each other. The church attempted to bring them
into line, but with the primitive technologies available to them, it
proved nearly impossible to keep the entire island constantly under
their thumb.

Over the centuries, a number of distinct city-states sprouted up on the
island. These various city-states were ruled by regional warlords, the
precursors to the [Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) class. Several of these
city-states are recorded in the Scriptures, particularly
[Edras](gEncrKUuU49lkOAgNgvkY), [Iphria](40Xji7LgN4imC5rbc4Tc1h),
[Istha](4IGx6wlK31zpVAsBqnGb8B) and [Melekel](5VmqiU201HhnPAivZUjWBE). This
societal state continued for several thousand years, in a period known
as the Time of Contemplation, as little of consequence was achieved by
the Amarr people.

### Rise of the Amarr Empire

This changed in 16470 AD, when a charismatic and highly religious
warlord rose to power in the city-state of
[Dam-Torsad](UI6KVmdCZ0H42EvHijFVZ). Known as
[Amash-Akura](4tm7IOIn0xaGeNFQcRl0Lc), this warlord began to conquer the
entire island in the name of God and the Scriptures. While many of his
conquests were military, Amash-Akura also used powerful rhetoric and
diplomacy to get the other warlords to bend their knees to him. Within
two decades, the entire Amarr Island was under Amash-Akura's control.

Amash-Akura founded the Amarr Empire and was crowned
[Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ). From the most loyal warlords and
pious religious men, he created the [Council of Apostles](nTZLcvZprqLLUiGIaVQu7), which would serve as the
central government of the Empire until the [Moral Reforms](48nuiRGJ4i8BwACDI9a58u). Much of his rule is confounded with
myths that sprang up surrounding him. The Scriptures record these
mythologizations as matters of historical record, leaving historians
little ability to separate fact from legend.

The rise of the Empire brought about significant change in Amarr
society. The [Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) class, rising from the warlords
who willingly submitted to Amash-Akura, was codified and entrenched in
Scripture. The Church, thanks to Amash-Akura's deep religious
convictions, achieved dominion over the Amarr people which it would
never relinquish.

### Udorian Arrival

For four thousand years, the Empire ruled over the Island in relative
peace, only having to rarely deal with peasant revolts and the
occasional religious heresies. Things rapidly changed in 20022 AD, when
the [Udorians](723tMHRDvyldo15RMLMuqh), who had established several
powerful nations on the southern continents of Cas-Udor and Ves-Udor,
arrived on Amarr Island. The ocean separating the island from the
southern continents was treacherous, but the Udorians had advanced to a
level of technology where they could make the journey in relative
safety.

Unlike the Amarr, the Udorians had developed a society that was much
less restrictive and far less religious. Primarily traders, the
discovery of the Empire gave the promise of a vast new source of profit
for the Udorians. The Amarr, however, were suspicious of the visitors
from the start. Several religious officials were familiar with the
Scriptures that told of the Amarr being driven from the mainland and
identified the Udorians as the culprits. Similarly, their society and
culture proved a great threat to the Holders, as it promised freedom and
virtual equality even for the common man.

For roughly 50 years, the Amarr and Udorians maintained an uneasy
relationship, with Udorian merchant ships bringing goods to the Empire
and taking away thousands of peasants who wished to escape oppression.
Things finally came to a head in 22078, when the Emperor ordered an
entire merchant fleet seized. Unprepared for hostilities, the merchants
and their crews were quickly overwhelmed and enslaved.

The [Reclaiming](70QLNGRwCwHUgmcjTmuhsA) was launched shortly after, with
the Amarr attacking the Udorian continents and finally returning to
Assimia to conquer it and enslave its people.

### Reclaiming

Life on Amarr Island was mostly untouched by the violence of the
Reclaiming. The Empire proved adept at war and quickly recruited
powerful allies on the continents, such as the scattered tribes that
would be later known as the [Khanid](1IRIdXfOZrfl5BuFuabOh6). Thus the
Udorians were unable to ever truly threaten Amarr Island, leaving its
citizens and Holders to live peaceful lives.

The Reclaiming did have a large impact on the island socially, however.
Hundreds of thousands of commoners joined the Emperor's armies, promised
glory, fame, and riches for serving in the Reclaiming. While many
soldiers died in the fighting, those who survived and prospered were
richly rewarded. For the first time in many thousands of years, a true
avenue of upward movement was introduced into Amarr society, as
commoners were raised to the ranks of Holder.

Similarly, riches from Assimia poured in to the island. Gold, silver,
precious gemstones, and other treasures were brought back by conquering
Holders. Boats full of Udorian slaves arrived daily, swelling the
population of the island and transforming the culture, as commoners
found their labors taken by slaves. Many turned to artistic pursuits,
while others traveled to the mainland in an effort to make their
fortunes there.

Within a few centuries, Amarr Island had been transformed from the
cornerstone of the Empire's power to a symbolic location. Though the
Emperor still ruled from Dam-Torsad, the majority of the Empire's
Holders and free citizens lived on Assimia and other continents. The
island remained the seat of the Empire, but its role as a truly vital
part of the Empire dwindled.

### Modern Day

With the entirety of Amarr Prime conquered by the Empire, Amarr Island
slowly began to regain prominence in the Empire. Without enemies to
conquer, the Empire entered a golden period of culture, arts, and
sciences. Amarr Island, particularly the Imperial city of Dam-Torsad,
was the center of this renaissance. Dam-Torsad grew slowly but steadily,
its boundaries constantly expanding as artisans and craftsmen flocked to
it to ply their trades. Wealthy Holders made Dam-Torsad their permanent
homes so they could be closer to the Emperor, leaving their estates in
the hands of seneschals and retainers.

Over time, Dam-Torsad grew into a megalopolis, stretching from one
corner of the island to the other. The old cities were consumed and
became nothing more than districts within the Imperial City. Today,
Amarr Island and Dam-Torsad are one and the same. The Emperor and Privy Council continue to rule from the city,
though in the age of space travel, it is as often as not that the
Emperor will not even be present.

Finally, the Cathedral of Dam-Torsad remains the most holy site in the
Empire. Billions make the pilgrimage to the Cathedral each year,
particularly around holidays, swelling the population of the island to
its limits.

Geography
---------

Amarr Island is a sub-tropical island with a length of just over 267 km
and a width of about 198 km. It naturally has a rocky, uneven coastline,
giving it an appearance that has been likened to an amoeba. However,
many of the more jagged areas have been smoothed or filled in, evening
the shape of the island, leaving it looking more ovular than in previous
centuries. The island is small enough that the umbra of an eclipse from
[Zorast](1PoS7ZiZUXSHjf81r7jkmq) can cover the entire island.

The island's natural climate is very mild. Temperature highs can reach
320 K in the harshest summer months, though they tend to stay around 305
to 310 K for most of the summer, with temperatures sitting around 300 K
for the autumn and spring. The winters tend to be cool and wet, with
temperatures below freezing being recorded only at the northern tip of
the island and then only rarely.

Much of the island is flat. Historically it was covered by large forests
and plains, though the city of Dam-Torsad covers the entire island
currently, leaving it without a true landscape. Most of the island's
hills and mountains have been flattened to accommodate growth, though at
least one religiously important mountain remains untouched.

Ecology
-------

The modern Amarr Island contains no wildlife, aside from urban pests
such as rats, fedoes, flies, and stray
[furriers](55Py0v5XOZySNC1oWsEV2O). Similarly, all plantlife is carefully
managed and grown in arboretums or ornamental gardens.

Prior to the expansion of Dam-Torsad, the island had numerous thick
forests and expansive plains. Hundreds of various unique species called
the island home, evolving in isolation from the mainland. Many of these
species have gone extinct thanks to the expansion of Dam-Torsad. One
avian species regularly migrated to the southern cliffs of the island
for their mating season, but died out following the construction of
several cathedrals along the coastline. Some species have managed to be
introduced to new habitats and thrive there, though many remain solely
as captives in zoos and menageries.
