# 7th Fleet
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/7th-fleet

**The 7th Fleet**, also known as the Saracens, are a celebrated branch
of the [Imperial Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g). Nicknamed for their fiery
and ambitious leader, Admiral [Vanazir Saracen](5yh6X5XInEkD9aWQnXPF5X), it achieved most fame for
its pacification actions in the [Bleak Lands](1thJ31aFnpCVAbE0rkntPP) late in
[YC109](7y1pTkEqQKTYMZRyVLLN8w) and early [YC 110](4s7KrRaqQANTatQhzlSaRi). Following the public disgrace of Admiral
Saracen, the fleet was reassigned to [Aridia](uPYIH9Hhde0bYIaZFR4eB) where
it continues to patrol.

History
-------

The 7th Fleet has a history that stretches back to the earliest days of
the [Reclaiming](70QLNGRwCwHUgmcjTmuhsA) on [Athra](1iTTAHnalOUkUy862B7GlG),
when the Imperial Navy was an archaic ocean-faring force. It had several
acclaimed units who served with distinction in the
[Udorian](723tMHRDvyldo15RMLMuqh) conquest. They were renowned for fighting
on the frontier and securing the rapidly shifting Imperial borders.

Following the conquest of Amarr Prime, the fleet continued mainly as a
peace keeping unit, patrolling trade lanes and rooting out criminals,
pirates, and heretics. Once the [Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
expanded its Reclaiming into space, the 7th Fleet followed suit,
transforming from a planetary force into an interstellar one and serving
mainly as a complimentary force in the Reclaiming of the
[Ealur](6TgmS6RKjOYM1Id08VBZzk) and the [Ni-Kunni](5zoewV2VJJnYgvWj0Khn1K).
They were considered highly effective
in snuffing out piracy and crime within its patrol routes, and following
the assassination of Emperor [Zaragram II](1DsGoYgw9GBQN8lqX77VlE), they
were instrumental in maintaining the peace, quickly dispersing rioters
and malcontents within their domain.

The 7th Fleet was on the forefront of the
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) conquest. It scored numerous victories
against the minimal Minmatar resistance, while effectively reducing loss
of life of potential slave populations. During the [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N), they served with distinction,
suffering fewer casualties than average and assisting heavily with the
evacuation of Amarr assets from Republic space.

It only served minimally in the [Sansha](6dFZYDkE3R4BRF9w21mtjP)
War, sending several minor detachments for cleanup duty at the end of
the war. During this time, they were primarily concerned with protecting
the Empire's borders from smugglers, pirates, and terrorists.

The Bleak Lands
---------------

By late YC109, the [Bleak Lands](1thJ31aFnpCVAbE0rkntPP) region had
becoming increasingly unstable, with mysterious attacks destroying
Imperial assets and driving local [Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) into a
frenzy. In response, the 7th Fleet rapidly transferred their might to
the region. The transfer was unexpected, occurring almost overnight,
with little warning from any Imperial authorities.

Basing out of Sahtogas, the fleet initially skirmished with [Blood Raiders](1HSqsKgCyL5sX6LpBVfElt),
drawing support from local
Holders. Admiral Saracen stated a goal of fortifying the Bleak Lands
so that no system was more than three jumps from a heavily fortified
installation. In order to fund the fortifications, Saracen undertook the
unusual step of enforcing a tithe on local Holders, a power usually
reserved for planetary and regional Viceroys. This move drew some
criticism from Holders, but was approved of by most residents of the
region.

The fortification was going well, when investigations revealed that the
mysterious attacks had not been perpetrated by Blood Raiders as
initially assumed. Following a surprise attack on the 7th Fleet
during a scheduled communications downtime, it was discovered that the
attacks had been carried out by the [Defiants](6aq75j8f7bMZckaqXWXSC6)
terrorist organization, a rogue detachment of the [Republic Fleet](2c4ZwKPnuW6mYkLJ2dGh94).

Early conflict between the 7th Fleet and Defiants favored the latter.
Defiants successfully destroyed installations in Haras and
compromised the region-wide defense network, though they reportedly
suffered high casualties as a result. Outside observers believed the 7th
Fleet had been caught off guard and severely underestimated the
capabilities of the Defiants.

Despite the destruction of their defensive cortex, the 7th Fleet
maintained an aggressive posture, thanks partly to loyalist capsuleer
forces serving as guards for military complexes. Thanks to the efforts
of cloaked scouts, they were able to ambush the Defiants during a
resupply mission in Kurniainen, destroying two capital ships, one
battleship, eight [cruisers](3wE5sDRggwgYjiExdCRyL0), and four
frigate class hulls.

The victory was short lived, however, as the Defiants mounted a massive
counter offensive. In several coordinated strikes, the Defiants
destroyed eight key military installations throughout the Sasen
constellation.

The 7th Fleet quickly recovered, thanks in part to their
[capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) allies, and stepped up their assaults
on the Defiants. It seemed they would wind up the victors, when Admiral
Saracen was suddenly recalled to the Throne Worlds on the order of
[Chamberlain Karsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL). Reports soon
emerged that the fleet had clashed with local Holders, some of them
turning violent. Saracen additionally had apparently been acting
independently from Imperial Navy orders.

Saracen was soon accused of treason by Chamberlain Karsoth and stripped
of all rank and titles. Evidence was released that stated the Admiral
planned to establish the Bleak Lands as a personal fief or even secede
from the Empire entirely. Leaderless and in disarray, the 7th Fleet
essentially stood down, remaining passively in the Bleak Lands for
further orders.

Shortly after, the remnants of the 7th Fleet was transferred to Aridia
to defend against possible [Serpentis](3igWGHqQJXyJoUnM2XgGJC)
incursions. The Fleet was bolstered with the remnants of the
[Kador Family](3ium7VluTCFnGS0TqpinlO) fleet, following the latter's
confiscation by Empress [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L).
