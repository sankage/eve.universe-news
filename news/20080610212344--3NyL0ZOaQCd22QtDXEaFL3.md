Jarizza â€“ Minmatar-Thukker warships have just engaged and destroyed several Ammatar Fleet patrols in the Derelik Region. It is unknown if these ships are part of the same task force which just destroyed CONCORD Bureau Station in Yulai. The unprovoked attack appears to have completely caught the Ammatar Fleet by surprise, as no organized resistance has been reported thus far.
