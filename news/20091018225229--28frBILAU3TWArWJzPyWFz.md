Intaki Prime, Placid - Recognizing gaps in the availability of some local products, the Intaki Liberation Front [ILF] have upgraded their starbase in the area to include a research and manufacturing facility.  
  
Under the leadership of corporation member Sumerio Rayej, the starbase has been producing several profitable items with a focus on small and medium ship rigs. An Ishkur, their first Tech 2 ship to be manufactured, is set to be completed within the next couple of days.[![](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3455/ilf2thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=)  
  
Sumerio explains why the research and manufacturing facility was deployed: "We believe Intaki needs a stronger economy if the lives of our people on the home world are to improve. It is also part of our vision of an independent Intaki... I hope that people will understand the [ILF]'s agenda is multi-pronged: martial, economic and political. Thus far, everyone seems to assume that we are just a disorganized fighting force looking to make trouble, but far from it."  
  
Most of the estimated 600 million ISK revenue generated so far has gone into improving the infrastructure of the starbase. With the [ILF] earning millions from their new facility, it remains to be seen if they will have any lasting impact on conditions in the area.
