It is believed that in attempt to support Ushra'Khan, residents of Providence including the Important Internet Spaceship League were laying siege to the system when a fleet of RAZOR Alliance capsuleers engaged them. As battle broke out, a fleet belonging to The Initiative turned up and engaged RAZOR Alliance.  
  
Luwc, A capsuleer in the Important Internet Spaceship League explained the situation: "We had the system locked down... and actually felt pretty safe with 250 [capsuleers] so we didn't expect a much smaller razor fleet to attack us."  
  
As Ushra'Khan systems remain uncertain territory, it is yet to be seen which alliances will take full advantage of the situation.
