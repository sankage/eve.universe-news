### Mysterious Data Slices Discovered

Capsuleers are reporting the discovery of mysterious data elements called “spectral emission slices”. These slices appear to contain temporal and spatial data. So far only part of the total data set has been recovered. The exact meaning of the information within is still unclear. While many theories have been suggested, none have yet been corroborated. 

This data is being conveyed in an unfamiliar format that emits trace blackbody radiation. It is not known who created the data or for what purpose. All that is known is that the slices have been discovered emerging from Abyssal rifts impacted by the conflict between the Triglavians and the Drifters; Deepflow Rifts and those under investigation by Abyssal Artifact Recovery operations.

The Scope reached out to SOCT scientists for answers, but they declined to comment. It is hoped that as more slices emerge so will greater insights into their meaning and origins. We will have more on this story as it unfolds.

### NET Resonators Deathless Origins Unmasked

Yulai - The CDIA has released the details of an investigation that proves NET resonators were developed by criminal organization, the Deathless Circle. NET resonators emerged as an advanced ship manufacturing component some months ago, replacing the need for neurolink conduits in subcapitals. Since then the component has been adopted by groups as diverse as the Sisters of EVE, Guristas Pirates, Sansha’s Nation, Blood Raiders, and more.

The revolutionary ship manufacturing component makes use of quantum consciousness neurolinking technology to provide the same performance as two different neurolink conduits in a single device. The CDIA has confirmed that this was backward-engineered from Jovian technology. The Deathless Circle has used its access to the Jovian station known as “The Fulcrum” to develop new advances based on ancient Jovian technologies.

The CDIA also presented evidence of multiple correlations between the introduction of the NET resonators and visits to organizations from known Deathless Circle agents. Most damning of these was evidence that leading members of the SOE had met with Deathless agents to receive the technology.

The Scope reached out to the SOE to explain their organization's connection with this known criminal group. Santimona Sarpati responded, “We in no way solicited the attention of the Deathless Circle, but were approached by one of their agents regardless. They offered to provide us with designs that would allow us to spend less on our ship development and more on our efforts to explore New Eden and support its people. After much debate, we decided it would be irresponsible not to make use of this technology.”

The motivations for this apparently charitable donation remain unclear, as do the specifics negotiated between the Deathless Circle and the more dangerous factions they have provided with NET resonators. 

### News In Brief

- Skirmishes in G3D-ZT have escalated into a dreadnought clash causing over 1.1 trillion ISK worth of damage. It is the most costly fight ever in the system's history.

- Rumors spread of growing tensions between Guristas, Angels, and Deathless as news of NET resonator gift to SOE spreads.

- Alliance Tournament XX seeding concluded with several teams opting for heavy assault missile platforms, possibly attempting to curry favor with the Guristas organizers.

- SOCT invites open applications from children across New Eden as part of new educational initiative.

- Alexander Ducasse speaks in defense of NET resonators at tech conference panel.
