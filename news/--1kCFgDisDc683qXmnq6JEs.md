# Year YC107
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/year-yc107

January
-------
January of
YC107 brought news of the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) Gaming
Commission's COLOSSUS race finals, with the date set for the 30th of the
month and the Commission promising to breathe new life into the gaming
industry with further [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) events. Betting
on the race final, which early estimates put at 100 billion ISK, soon
reached 300 billion ISK - an extraordinary amount demonstrating the
wealth available to capsuleers.

With the Caldari Gaming Commission having announced prizes of
fully-fitted [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) ships for the
winners of the COLOSSUS race, anticipation was high on the day of the
race final. With racers beginning their marathon in the Fountain region,
many fell afoul of blockading capsuleers early on, though plenty punched
through to continue the race into Cloud Ring where more attackers lay in
wait. Surviving racers sprinted to the race finish deep in the Branch
region and Team [Lai Dai](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT) swept the
board, taking the team contest and placing 1st, 2nd and 3rd in the
individual pilots contest.

February
--------

The Caldari Gaming Commission hosted an award ceremony in honor of Team
Lai Dai early in February, and the Caldari State's [Chief Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr) congratulated Lai Dai together
with the runner-up teams of the
[Wiyrkomi](66psXtrftjRzA7MyKHtb7K) and
[Hyasyoda](WisddAsk7hie3SUcwiNwa) corporations.

March
-----

[Zainou Biotech](4bKBzWAifvRRbnXs3i9ZnE)
suffered a serious security breach in March, when two leading
scientists, the biochemist Ullia Hnolku and his wife, Eckarine
Mitumi-Hnolku, went missing, believed to be in possession of a
classified drug known as [Insorum](insorum). Zainou, a
subsidiary of Caldari State megacorporation
[Ishukone](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI), suffered massive drops on
the stock markets as soon as the news emerged, with many questioning the
future of the biotechnology leader.

The Jorvel Nekarr incident greatly concerned the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) for much of March, beginning with the capture
of the rogue Amarr agent in Misaba system. After taking Nekarr to the
nearby [Zoar and Sons](zoar-and-sons) station in system, the
[Amarr Imperial Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g) began to initiate
quarantine procedures and place massive security cordons around the
station.

Affairs took on a very serious character when an agent of the
Caldari-based Takamatsu Trading Exchange penetrated the Zoar and Sons
station and caused a security alert throughout the Empire. Hunted down
by the Navy and independent capsuleers, Kani Odana was killed before he
could pass on any information he may have gathered. Takamatsu and the
Amarr Empire vigorously disputed these events but to no avail for
Takamatsu. The Amarr soon decided to move whatever investigations were
taking place in Misaba to a secure facility out of the way of prying
eyes.

April
-----

CONCORD's Directive Enforcement Department
([DED](1xZoOUsqaDhJw7gQffHMFC)) released a report in April revealing that
increased numbers of illegal deadspace outposts were being established
on the fringes of CONCORD-patrolled space. Of particular concern was
news that [Sansha's Nation](6dFZYDkE3R4BRF9w21mtjP) and the
[Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) were rapidly expanding their holdings in
deadspace pockets.

The investigation into the disappearance of biochemist Ullia Hnolku and
his wife Eckarine Mitumi-Hnolku acquired new urgency when it was
discovered that the compound insorzapine bisulfate, known as "Insorum",
could pose a serious threat to public health. In light of this, the
Caldari Navy took over the investigation and search for the missing
scientists but soon ran into problems when the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) filed a formal complaint against it with
CONCORD. Caldari Navy ships were alleged to have docked at a [Republic Fleet](2c4ZwKPnuW6mYkLJ2dGh94) station without permission - in
breach of the Yulai Convention - while searching for the Hnolkus. Just
as the affair seemed to be spiraling out of control, leaked Zainou
Biotech reports indicated that the Insorum mutagen was not as dangerous
as earlier reports had suggested. This calmed matters down but raised a
number of questions as to the conduct of Zainou and its parent
corporation Ishukone.

In the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK), [President](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E) [Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) experienced a setback in his
campaign to be the first two-term President of the Federation when his
delegates blundered, failing to properly launch his campaign and
correctly starting the process of appointing his election emissaries.
Opponents Eman Autrech and [Mentas Blaque](1bZzUGejHEhyHp6LVUtjBT), in
contrast, began their campaigns smoothly and were soon making political
capital at the expense of the embarrassed incumbent.

May
---

May brought further developments in the Insorum Affair, as news agencies
across [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) broke the news that the
insorzapine bisulfate compound was believed to be capable of reversing
the effects of the mutagenic drug [Vitoc](4HUZbTn03CVY7jskAAE4qx). The
missing Ullia Hnolku and wife Eckarine Mitumi-Hnolku were still believed
to be carrying samples of the drug, together with key knowledge as to
its manufacture, leading to reports that the Amarr Empire was mobilizing
navy units to search for the scientists in light of the newly-reported
properties of the substance.

More misfortune hit the Foiritan
administration when a large [Serpentis](3igWGHqQJXyJoUnM2XgGJC) strike
force attacked Gallente Federation assets in the Alperaute system and
succeeded in hijacking the Molyneux, one of the six Soltueur-class
[Titans](XH5ZPvSBGGIStAEWqWHOl) controlled by the Federation Navy. Gallente
intelligence was later able to identify Serpentis Corporation CEO
[Salvador Sarpati](4uoKdzOSHLBe297ANAvD2G) himself as the leader of
the attack that resulted in the capture of the Molyneux. The Federation
Navy placed a 1.2 billion ISK bounty on Sarpati's head, making him the
most wanted man in New Eden, with his henchman [Tuvan Orth](7fIaLBDm9voZfRJz5iIfKR) attracting a 500 million ISK bounty.
Despite these efforts, Sarpati was able to escape with his new ship back
to Serpentis space, leading to accusations of apathy against Foiritan as
it was confirmed there were no plans to send Federation forces into
nullsec in an effort to recover the lost Titan.

The Insorum Affair took another twist late in May when [Omir Sarikusa](6UYaNpBPqY1ls1ps78PPPt), dreaded leader of the [Blood Raider](7obiU8rOyJkPZ3S0Faxc5W) Covenant, claimed responsibility for
kidnapping Eckarine Mitumi-Hnolku, wife of Ullia Hnolku, the biochemist
whose defection with samples of the Insorum drug alerted New Eden to its
existence. The Blood Raider chief went on to claim that his
organization was in control of a prototype of the Insorum drug and was
prepared to use it to strike at the Amarr Empire. Confirmation of his
claim to have captured Mitumi-Hnolku came with shocking images of her
being subjected the Blood Raider rituals of
'[blooding](5UHvE5Sg9PIgO0JfgIkMqa),' with Caldari State sources confirming
the woman shown to be Ullia Hnolku's wife.

Within days of the Blood
Raider announcement, Ullia Hnolku was dead. Apparently driven from cover
by desperation at the kidnapping of his wife, Hnolku enlisted the
assistance of a number of Minmatar capsuleers, keen to gain access to
Insorum for purposes of freeing the legions of Minmatar
[slaves](slavery) suffering under the chemical cosh of Vitoc.
As Hnolku prepared to meet with the capsuleers, he was attacked aboard
the station he had been hiding in and suffered a grievous knife wound.
Managing to board a shuttle, Dr. Hnolku departed the station, escorted
by a large force of Minmatar freedom-fighters. Along the way, possibly
suffering impaired judgment as a result of blood loss, Dr. Hnolku made a
premature jump through a [stargate](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) and fell into
an ambush set up by Caldari capsuleers. His unarmed and unarmored ship
was summarily destroyed.

June
----

Reports from nullsec sources in June indicated that relations between
[Outer Ring Excavations](vtyIqELC7ngvFuWla7baP) (ORE) and
their security providers [Mordu's Legion](5csCeDqUe1exvVyfPdL75Q)
were deteriorating to breaking point. Due to their rumored history of
persistently bad relations, it was suggested that personal disputes
between ORE CEO Orion Mashel and Legion chief Muriya Mordu had gotten
beyond the point of reconciliation.

Eclipsing all other events of June, and arguably the entire year YC107
to date, was the Mabnen Incident on the ninth day of the month, when a
chemical attack led to shocking destruction on the planet of Mabnen I in
the Amarr Empire. Beginning with the distribution of an aerosol agent
into the atmosphere of Mabnen I, centered on the Hemlock Field complex
of slave colonies, the attack was initially thought to have been foiled
when the vessels releasing the chemical were shot down by Amarr security
forces. This assumption was shown to be premature as a number of slave
colonies experienced rioting and were soon in flames. By mid-morning,
seven of the twelve colonies in the vast complex were out of
communication with Amarr authorities and the military was being called
in to restore order.

At noon, Omir Sarikusa
broadcast a statement claiming full responsibility for the attack on
Mabnen I, revealing that the Blood Raider Covenant had released an
aerosol form of the nsorum drug into the atmosphere of the planet. There
was no reaction from the Amarr Empire to this claim but reports
suggested that [Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) [Doriam II](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT) had begun a series of emergency meetings with
his top advisors. As the day wore on, Mabnen I descended into chaos.
Rebelling slaves spilled out of the colonies and wrought havoc across
the affected region.

Citizens of the Minmatar Republic reacted with joy to the news of the
slave revolts, hailing Insorum as a cure for the scourge of Vitoc.
Republic [Prime Minister](11bdx7zZVOpLMWvWjjUg7c) [Karin Midular](3KxlNVAeglPj5ZH0sf3U2j) urged the Blood Raider Covenant to
contact the Republic to discuss peaceful use of the Insorum drug. While
this may have been done for show, many thought the suggestion hopelessly
naive. The Caldari State insisted it intended to take no action over the
Mabnen Incident, refusing to see itself involved in a purely internal
affair of the Amarr Empire despite the origins of the Insorum drug and
the continuing captivity of Eckarine Mitumi-Hnolku.

Clearly mindful of the role of its subsidiary Zainou Biotech in the
Insorum Affair, the Ishukone Corporation went even further, denying all
responsibility for the Mabnen I slave-revolts and insisting that the
Blood Raider Covenant had significantly altered the Insorum drug, using
it in a weaponized form not envisaged or developed by Zainou Biotech.

Emerging from his councils, Emperor Doriam II responded to the Mabnen
attack by declaring all-out war on the Blood Raider Covenant.
Acknowledging that a blow had been dealt to the Amarr Empire, the
Emperor promised that every arm of the Amarr military would be raised
against Omir Sarikusa and the Covenant. Ministry of War officials
confirmed that a massive mobilization of the Imperial Navy was underway
and preparations for orbital and suborbital warfare were being made. The
object of the campaign was to be the annihilation of the Blood Raider
Covenant.

Fighting was not long in starting, with the second half of the month
seeing sustained strikes against Blood Raider installations in their
Bleak Lands stronghold. With capsuleers engaging on both sides, the
brutal fighting was said to have resulted in Blood Raider losses
amounting to billions of ISK, as the forces of the Amarr Empire targeted
key Covenant facilities across the region.

July
----

With the campaign against the Blood Raider Covenant going well, July
should have been a victorious month for the Amarr Empire but was swiftly
turned into a time of tragedy and mourning. Matters began well enough as
the Imperial Navy dealt what it called a 'crushing blow' to the Blood
Raiders, destroying one of its major installations in the Sahtogas
system, the center of Blood Raider power in the Bleak Lands. The Empire
claimed the facility to have housed the Blood Raider's Insorum research
laboratories, stocks of the drug and a large munitions dump. After this,
it did indeed seem that victory had been achieved. The Covenant fielded
no significant battlegroups, and only scouting and raiding parties were
sighted within the Amarr Empire.

Then came the
assassination of [Doriam II](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT), stunning the Amarr
Empire and shocking the New Eden cluster. The death of the Emperor was
confirmed by [Court Chamberlain](4cstqCKrXLAu5XDiqztSe6) [Dochuta Karsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL), who was unwilling to shed any
light on rumours as to the identity of the assassin, preferring to
condemn the act as 'heinous' and lament Amarr's 'unspeakable tragedy.'
Imperial Navy squadrons were placed on full alert with patrols
particularly heavy on the Republic and Federation borders.

While the details of the assassination trickled out, confirming that the
killing took place in the Imperial Palace in Dam-Torsad, the major
empires of New Eden reacted with horror. The Caldari State's Chief
Executive Panel unanimously condemned the 'appalling atrocity,' while
Republic Prime Minister Karin Midular described the assassination as an
'act of cowardice.' The various political institutions of the Gallente
Federation also condemned the murder, expressing the view that it should
not be allowed to threaten the peace between the empires.

Within a fortnight, claims that CONCORD had identified Doriam II's
assassins surfaced after a meeting between investigators and Chamberlain
Karsoth. This prompted the Chief Executive Panel to dismiss CONCORD's
findings as amounting to 'zero.' It also caused Omir Sarikusa to issue a
mocking statement, pouring scorn on the efforts of CONCORD. Although the
Blood Raider chief made no claims of Blood Raider involvement in the
assassination, he did declare that the Covenant would strike at the
Amarr Empire from their new bases in Delve region.

August
------

CONCORD's investigation into the assassination of Doriam II caused more
controversy in August when a memo suggesting a connection with the
[Royal Khanid Navy](nQJFwBFQzGij9cZKKCrm7) was leaked. The
memorandum also revealed that CONCORD were preparing to insert agents
into the RKN as part of the investigation. This provoked a strong denial
of any involvement by the Khanid Navy and demands that CONCORD cease
infiltration operations aimed against it.

A grim discovery was made in the Amarr system when prominent slaveholder
Rezini Lifu was found dead and mutilated in his home. His slaves, all
trained as gladiators, were reported missing along with several combat
vessels. A later raid by gladiatorial ships on an Amarr Vitoc convoy in
Rasile system was soon linked to the Lifu case.

September
---------

Another Vitoc shipment was attacked, and this time destroyed, in early
September, as it made its way to Amarr. Escaped gladiator slaves were
again believed to be responsible for the attack, as two bodies
identified as former slaves of recently-killed slaveholder Bamadak Pareh
were discovered bearing tell-tale signs of death from Vitoc withdrawal.
Later in the month, an even more grisly discovery was made as over 70
bodies belonging to Minmatar slaves, many of them gladiators, were found
dead in a disused hangar in the Zaimeth system. Many of the bodies were
identified as former slaves of the slain slaveholders Rezini Lifu and
Bamadak Pareh.

October
-------

October brought fleeting sightings
of other escaped gladiators, though soon enough most of them
disappeared, never to be heard from again. Sporadic pirate activity was
a highlight of the first week of the month, with a Guristas task force
being destroyed by the Caldari Navy; Serpentis ships sighted on the
Federation border; and a Blood Raider task force succeeding in stealing
seven Navy Issue Apocalypses from shipyards in Khanid Prime. A later
assault by Serpentis forces in Placid was speculated to be an attempt by
the rogue corporation to destabilize the Gallente Federation elections.

More peculiar was the case of two scientists embarked on a project to
build a 'brain wave control' device. Dr. Albert Vance and Dr. Victor
Stats first emerged into public view as they tried to recruit Caldari
capsuleers to supply electronic parts for their research project.
Rapidly reported to the authorities amid increasing alarm at the
megalomaniacal claims being made by Dr. Vance, the pair were forced
underground when the Caldari Business Tribunal launched an investigation
into the Vance and Stats project.

November
--------

The fugitive scientists were reported to have shifted to attempting to
recruit among Amarr capsuleers in early November. In response, Caldari
judges took the step of issuing 'kill-on-sight' warrants against Vance
and Stats.

The Insorum Affair was given a sad coda with news from a source within
the Blood Raider Covenant that Eckarine Mitumi-Hnolku, wife of the late
biochemist Ullia Hnolku, had been broken by months of captivity and
regular subjection to vile Blood Raider rituals. As it was suggested
that the Blood Raiders had destroyed her old personality and were
attempting to insert a new one, loyal to the Covenant, it seemed
Mitumi-Hnolku was beyond all help.

December
--------

The Amarr Empire
issued an interim report on the investigation into the assassination of
Emperor Doriam II in December. Serving primarily to dismiss any claims
arising from leaked CONCORD memos, the report made vague suggestions of
progress in identifying the killers but accepted that key conspirators
were at large and remained unidentified. The report also stated that
Amarr investigators could no find no evidence whatsoever of involvement
by any neighboring state, or personnel associated with government
organizations within or outside the Empire. The [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj) was quick to highlight this,
repeating once more its repudiation of suggestions in one CONCORD memo
that the Kingdom had had some involvement in the assassination.

The increasingly buffoonish Albert Vance and Victor Stats were exposed
as failures when, following their escape from Caldari agents, they
attempted to demonstrate their 'mind control device' only for it to
spectacularly fail, afflicting Stats, serving as test subject, with
obvious mental impairment. The communications feed to their facility was
severed before agents of the Caldari Business Tribunal could trace them.

As the year approached its end, the Caldari Gaming Commission announced
surprise plans to hold a Capsuleer Alliance Tournament in the last week
of December. Hastily-assembled teams began to compete for the coveted
title of Alliance Tournament Champions on the 28th, with many surprising
and thrilling fights in the first rounds. Battling through the
elimination tiers, Band of Brothers and KAOS Empire met in the grand
final to provide a fitting climax to the tournament. In a tremendously
close battle, it came down to BOB's sole-surviving Eagle-class Heavy
Assault against a KAOS Deimos-class Heavy Assault and Ishkur-class
Assault Frigate. In a remarkable display of shield-tanking, the Eagle
triumphed, winning the first championship on behalf of the Band of
Brothers.
