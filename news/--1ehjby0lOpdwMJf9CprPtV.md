# Gallente-Caldari War
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/gallente-caldari-war

The first **Gallente-Caldari War** broke out nearly two centuries ago when the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) seceded from the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK). The war lasted nearly 100 years and was more or less fought to a stalemate. Both sides agreed to a peace treaty after the Gallente Senator [Aidonis Elabon](3IcoxAofkzoA9VQJbk5mPE) founded [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt), and convinced both the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) and [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) to join.
