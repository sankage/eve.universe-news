# Cryonic Stasis
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/cryonic-stasis

**Cryonic stasis** is the absolute dormant, frozen state of biological
entities that have been cryopreserved. Before the advent of hyperspace
and [stargate](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) technology,
[cryopreservation](7BF7vZ7qnXecyOK0spBAxA) was used by colonists
traveling immense distances using sublight propulsion methods. The
method is rarely used today, but the technology still exists.
