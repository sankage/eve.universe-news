# Damella Macaper
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/damella-macaper

Damella Macaper was a [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) astronomer who lived a century ago. She wrote a book called "The Seven Events of
the Apocalypse" in which she prophesied the end of the world.

Damella was not taken seriously by her peers; they described her as a "hack" and a "nutcase", and her book was largely ignored except by a small cult following. She died shortly after her book was published and as a result, the cult dwindled rapidly.
