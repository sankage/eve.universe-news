# Isogen-5
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/isogen-5

Isogen-5 is an exceedingly rare, extremely unstable variant of
isogen found only in blue bright star (Type O1) systems. Its rarity is
at a point that until recently it was half-believed to be only
theoretical in nature. It glows very brightly.

Isogen-5 may have been used to fuel [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L)'s superweapon.

This mineral variant has been deliberately placed throughout every
system in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) and beyond in
numerous stockpiles for a very specific, unknown purpose by an ancient
race with a vision beyond the grasp of modern science, and the
technological advancement to execute that vision.
