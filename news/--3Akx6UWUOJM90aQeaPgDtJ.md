# Amarr Emperor
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/amarr-emperor

The **Amarr Emperor** is the head of state and appoints the head
of government, the [Chancellor](7GOV3morIu47J3BmidrhU8); he/she
also appoints the [Court Chamberlain](4cstqCKrXLAu5XDiqztSe6) and
[Ammatar Governor](ammatar-governor). The office of
Emperor has experienced many transformations in its history. It began as
a principate and transformed later to Caesaropapism. The time of the
Principate was from AD 16470 to 21460, at this time the
[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) Emperor was the leader of the Apostles, the
first among equals, and his authority was channeled through the [Council of Apostles](nTZLcvZprqLLUiGIaVQu7).

After the [Moral Reforms](48nuiRGJ4i8BwACDI9a58u) the
Emperors became more powerful as secular leaders and also as supreme
heads of the church; it was the beginning of the modern emperors. The
Emperor's authority is unquestioned and absolute, but the archaic and
bureaucratic system of government – including a series of
checks-and-balances encountered both in the entrenched Empire
institutions and in the rule of various local barons within the
empire – makes it difficult for him to exert his rule unless
directly in person. Otherwise, the Heirs rule in his name, dividing
the huge empire between them.

The closest that can be defined as his personal administrative body is
the [Emperor Family](IXrotYvoWOVnuGAMbbYEv). Realistically, the main
support of an Emperor's power and authority is the military. Being paid
by the imperial treasury, the soldiers ([Paladins](n1Ta6TQKn4vEKTzacqhVJ))
also swore an annual military oath of loyalty towards him.

On an imperial level, on the imperial court, the most powerful
individuals are the Chancellor, the Chamberlain, the Emperor Family, and
arguably the Ammatar Governor. In addition to the
[imperial offices](6lg0vegSyiF2IoOlrq8bUT), the Privy Council exists as a major imperial decision-making body. In order to
maintain the administration's cohesion as a central body with the
provinces of the empire, the emperor relies on the Privy Council, which
functions, among other things, as a place where the [royal families](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh)
meet the Emperor. The Privy Council
itself is the highest administrative body in the Amarr Empire's civil
hierarchy, forming the emperor's personal advisory council. In theory it
is a gathering of the reigning emperor's most trusted advisors from
various branches of government, assembling to offer advice and
suggestions for the emperor's consideration.
