Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/old-colony

The **Old Colony** was a [mining colony](6NQhah6uyVb1Bzg0ifUe5N)
managed by a man named [Melvue](3lGS0xpEmMiYeWCooS7r4O).
[Terden](1sPT9mgFxMiUPJZ5BWO25A), [Fermar](7cLMQC182YuCCSfazxcPbY) and
[Carla](5AayhzH0qq6dpQhEjLkyXz) were among the people living there. Melvue
surrendered the colony to the [Sansha](6dFZYDkE3R4BRF9w21mtjP), yet
some people - Fermar among them - still attempted to put up an armed
resistance.
