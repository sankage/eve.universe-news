"A GOD" and "Brecher" arrived in Yulai tonight with their fourth and final shipment, concluding their contract with GDI. A somewhat harried Mr. Jetson Bills arrived late to the meeting, however the two contractors were more than patient and did not seem to mind the slight delay. 

The last shipment was recieved and both parties were pleased with the results. Both contractors were anxious for any clues Mr. Bills could give them about the surprise reward for the finished contract. When Mr. Bills was asked regarding their surprised rewards his tight lipped answer was: "It will make jobs like what you did easier".
