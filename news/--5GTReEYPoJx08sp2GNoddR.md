February, YC111
===============

Tournament Closes and War Continues
-----------------------------------

 The 6th Alliance Tournament came to an end in
early February, with Pandemic Legion defeating R.U.R. alliance in a
thrilling final match between the latter's Caracal Navy Issues and
Abaddon team and Pandemic's Vexor Navy Issue and
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) command ship squad. Having already
defeated the defending champions of Ev0ke alliance in the semi-finals,
their victory in the final saw Pandemic Legion crowned Alliance
Champions for the first time after a history of strong showings in
previous tournaments.

The continuing war with the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK)
and the occupation of [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i)
continued to be sources of contention throughout the month. The
[Wiyrkomi Peace Corps](tdQPTaCTtXveoZlyNTHQs), the security
arm of the patriot faction [Wiyrkomi Corporation](66psXtrftjRzA7MyKHtb7K), announced it was sending
an additional full brigade of troops to take part in the occupation of
the [Caldari's](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) original homeworld. This highlighted
the involvement of a number of corporate security troop forces belonging
to such megacorporations as
[Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK), [Lai Dai Corporation](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT) and Wiyrkomi alongside [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) marines and
Provist troops on Caldari
Prime. The Wiyrkomi deployment was considered to mark a shift away from
such corporate forces working mainly as defense forces around assets
seized by megacorps toward being contract troops answering to the
Caldari provisional government on the planet.

Ishukone Contendors Speak
-------------------------

While patriot corporations such as Wiyrkomi continued to be unstinting
in their support of the occupation and general war effort, [Ishukone Watch](21GQBhNgawJQQ39wqVX4yU) CEO Mens Reppola spoke out on the
subject of the occupation on the political talk show *Games of State*.
Referring to the recent report on the costs of occupation, Reppola
charged that the occupation was "a logistical nightmare ... draining
the resources of the State." The former Navy captain went on to point
out that the Caldari Navy was conceived and organized as a defensive
force that could not sustain an offensive of [the Scope](2XUuFn5Lte67YYxmxj86Yt) and length of the occupation and the
continuing war against the Gallente Federation. With his candidacy for
the [Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) chief
executive seat now well-known, Reppola also spoke of the importance of
solving problems in the interests of employees and the State itself,
emphasizing that this had been the approach of the late Ishukone CEO
[Otro Gariushi](5QydCJCoYvbvbWvFlAlbHg).

Mens Reppola had also been critical of the Caldari offensive in Verge
Vendor in his remarks on Games of State and the campaign in the region
swiftly resulted in sky-rocketing insurance and shipping rates, driving
many freight companies and independent pilots away from the region. In
other shipping news, a crippled Iteron-class
[industrial](oPGFihhst5FK2rjcaxUsx) vessel was discovered burned out in
space with all hands lost in the Caslemon system, Essence region.
Mystery surrounded the vessel's fate and its purposes, with no public
records of its cargo or destination available, until a [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) statement was issued confirming the
ship had been contracted by the Navy to relocate military equipment. The
statement also revealed that an investigation had concluded that the
ship had been destroyed by demolition charges set inside the vessel
after its cargo had been stolen. The Federation Navy blamed the Caldari
for this raid but questions were raised as to why there had been no
naval escort.

[Minedrill](2cjgnHBuWiKY7pH2xjzvG0) CEO Soisonen Okalala, a candidate for
the Ishukone CEO spot, used an appearance on *This is The State* to
respond to fellow candidate Mens Reppola's remarks on the occupation of
Caldari Prime and the course of the war against the Gallente Federation.
Okalala suggested that the report on the costs of the occupation was too
narrowly-focused and did not balance the costs against the gains. The
Minedrill CEO also congratulated the [State Protectorate](2VlyV0CDyxFv0Qg3N3dW8k) for its efforts in Verge
Vendor and expressed support for the approach of State Executor [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG) with regard to the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) and the economic agreement with them. These
last remarks were perhaps a response to criticisms from within the State
over an agreement between the mining conglomerate [Ducia Foundry](6sCdhoug6FOa0zTTypjzvd) and the [State and Region Bank](26XJchU8cSXHX1wWooavzA) securing 50bn ISK of financing
for the Amarr corporation.

Corporate Disputes
------------------

Heightened and at times contentious activity between Caldari
corporations seemed to be a feature of the month's events, with
[Hyasyoda Corporation](WisddAsk7hie3SUcwiNwa) walking out of
negotiations with [Zainou](4bKBzWAifvRRbnXs3i9ZnE) over a supply
contract, Minedrill and [Top Down](5D3Z7xo3S9krERwyH9WHFT) Retail entering
into a partnership to develop new mining technology and [Caldari Business Tribunal](32Y4no5DBn6kGO5HnWuYgH) investigators
raiding Ishukone Corporation's offices in Oimmo system. This last
incident proved to be embarrassing for the Caldari Providence
Directorate, which had prompted the CBT to take the action and sent its
own troops to participate in the investigators' raid. Within the day,
Ishukone Watch made over 300 arrests among Ishukone personnel on charges
of aiding piracy and corporate corruption throughout the Mito
constellation.

Apparently the result of a longstanding Watch investigation and
surveillance operation, the Ishukone security arm was forced to make its
move prematurely when the CBT/Provist raid interrupted its surveillance
and alerted some targets of their operation. The Watch stated that
almost 50 suspects had eluded capture, among them some of the 'worst
offenders.' When the Caldari Providence Directorate suit against
Ishukone Corporation went the the Tribunal's Regional Court it was
dismissed, vindicating the position of Ishukone and leaving the Provists
sorely disappointed. Ishukone chose to leave the matter there,
refraining from exercising its option of a countersuit over the
premature raid and disruption to its business and that of Ishukone
Watch's surveillance operation. More good press for Ishukone Watch CEO
Mens Reppola came when he intervened in the dispute between Hyasyoda and
Zainou to bring about a return to negotiations between the two
corporations.

Treason and Salvation
---------------------

In the Amarr Empire, news of the arrest of the [Ammatar Fleet](3as0Qu7kajUNvkjJdBSwF1) Grand Admiral Einkur Aro on the
orders of [Amarr Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) [Yonis Ardishapur](4Tb1Uk75SycuFuiizODkZD) shocked many across the
[Ammatar Mandate](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz). The charges against Admiral Aro
were listed as dereliction of duty, failure to prevent mutiny and
treason. Speaking about his decision to order the arrest over six months
after the Elder Invasion exposed serious deficiencies in the Ammatar
Fleet and sparked widespread defections from its ranks, Yonis Ardishapur
noted that "as the one in charge Grand Admiral Aro is totally
responsible for the failures and actions of his men." The action caused
much disquiet within the ranks of the Ammatar Fleet, with many fearing a
general purge. On this the Royal Heir would only say that he had 'yet to
decide how deep the ineptitude in the Fleet runs.'

In Amarr itself, a charismatic former slave and cleric in the Salvation
Church of Blessed Servititude, [Abel Jarek](5HDj1enu8OW6rTNg6d9dR8),
declared his intention to lead a "Salvation Crusade" from Amarr to
[Pator](7MdCKy2OEJTpJSItRgx8DX), home system of the Minmatar. Accompanied by 214 Minmatar former
slaves, Jarek left Amarr aboard a chartered transport and began to tour
around Amarr systems picking up more former slaves to take part in his
'crusade.' The Salvation Crusade ships were soon preparing to cross into
Minmatar space where they would have to leave behind their House Sarum
security escort, the presence of which was an apparent sign of favor
from the [Sarum Family](4EZ4a3Mw8QXHmisAA4Ff6L).

Crossing into Minmatar space towards the middle of February, Abel
Jarek's small fleet of ships encountered several hostile vessels in Auga
system. Mostly consisting of attack
[frigates](6FJmBYuBTwDdtiiH8kIHsA) of the Rifter-class, the hostile
fleet ordered the Salvation Crusaders to turn back into Amarr space
after halting Jarek's ship with a [warp disruptor](4uAflvhPRUB2142ZCg8hmw). Abel Jarek is believed to have
immediately refused this order but the stand-off was prevented from
descending into deadly violence by the arrival of Caldari mercenaries in
several powerful ships, including three Cerberus-class missile cruisers
and two Rook-class electronic warfare cruisers. These mercenaries jammed
the Minmatar frigates and escorted the Salvation Crusaders on their
journey to [Pator](7MdCKy2OEJTpJSItRgx8DX) system. Arriving in the Minmatar
home system, Jarek and his followers landed on [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6)
and set up a camp in the largest refugee holding zone on the Minmatar
homeworld.

Ever since news of the
'crusade' had reached the Minmatar Republic there had been much
controversy and strong feelings of antipathy, as evidence by the
unofficial attempt to halt Jarek at the border. However, as returning
slaves claiming Republic citizenship, Jarek and his followers could not
be stopped by the Minmatar government despite the outrage their arrival
and plan to build an Amarr chapel in the refugee camp caused. This
outrage manifested itself in a number of violent arguments and minor
scuffles when Jarek's followers ventured into the main camp to preach.
This hostility culminated in a major escalation when a several-hundred
strong group of rioters, apparently led by masked men directing the
crowd's actions, broke into the Salvation Crusade compound and burned
their Amarr chapel down. The violence resulted in numerous injuries
among Jarek's followers but there were no deaths. Complaints that the
local police and fire services took too long to arrive were dismissed by
the Matar authorities. For his part, Abel Jarek was defiant and vowed to
'continue to spread the word of God' among the Minmatar.

Troubles in the Republic
------------------------

Other problems in the Minmatar Republic emerged in late February, with
Aidonis Medical - a medical and aid charity run by the [Aidonis Foundation](2ZdUwi6lEN75YZoamvXA72) - warning that food supplies to
the Republic were at risk due to shortages in Verge Vendor region caused
by the ongoing Caldari offensive and consequent contraction of shipping
volumes. Added to this was increased tension over the issue of land in
the Minmatar Republic caused by a rising immigrant population and, in
particular, the return of the [Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2) and
[Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) tribes. With members of both tribes
pressing claims to ancestral lands distributed to other parties or held
by the Minmatar government in their absence a considerable increase in
land disputes was reported by the Minmatar land and estates agency
[Urban Management](wIqOeOMc7BHuJaMPwbe1M).
