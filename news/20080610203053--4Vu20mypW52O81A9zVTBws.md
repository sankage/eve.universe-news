Jita - With CONCORD out of commission the Jita System was struck hard by pirates trying to take advantage of the lack of defence for all traders now leaving the biggest trade hub in EVE. 

Several ships have been reported destroyed outside all stations. The sentry guns guarding the stations have been reported unable to keep up with all aggression taking place and without CONCORD to protect the traders events are rapidly degenerating the Jita System into a warzone on its own. 

Convoys are being urged to stay docked until law and order can be re-established. Naval vessels in the system appear to be unable to deal with the situation and no information has been given on when reinforcements will be available.
