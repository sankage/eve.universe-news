# Gallente fashion
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/gallente-fashion

**Gallente fashion** is very eclectic.

"Walk down the street of any town on any modern [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) planet and you'll see a thousand different fashions all walking past each other. Some calm, some loud, some downright perverse (ever hear of a place called the [Caduceus](670J6Ig4gvuntTXjO4v0E0), on [Sovicou](3bFH4a0UeEG2PRs7vkKcBu)? Eugh, don't ask, you don't really want to know). Each and every one of us tries to seize individuality as hard as we can. It's what's made the Federation the wonderful mess of a melting pot it is today."

"Any citizen with half a brain can understand that the freedoms that let us wear translucent clothing aren't exactly looked on favorably elsewhere. (I'll admit not everyone has that much of a brain, and again, you want examples, head for Sovicou... or better yet, don't.)"
