**Jeanelle** is a [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) mercenary. She has a
background in politics and entertainment. At one point, she was a in a
presumably romantic relationship with [Uriam Kador](7LJKelrqDXAAUYi6o48Uno). The relationship eventually soured,
which Jeanelle attributed to his inability to handle failure. She
received a scar between her breasts, presumably as a result of Kador's
aforementioned personal failing. Despite this falling out, she
maintained numerous contacts in Kador's royal court.

The merc team Jeanelle belonged to was hired by the
Federation to discover the location of [Anvent Eturrer](4ft267N4XjELE5by1uHCt5). Despite initial concern that her
prior relationship with Kador would hinder the mission, she proved
valuable and was able to learn of Eturrer's potential whereabouts from a
conversation with one of Kador's court. However, one of the other mercs,
a Caldari named [Skids](51Xxa9YLYD6k1cW0Z3EETN), attempted to stop her. Jeanelle had planned for this eventuality and activated a [Dead man's switch](3Z5w49e94cXP0OFn0iBBQk) in Skids that knocked her
unconscious. Skids's memory was then wiped of the event.
