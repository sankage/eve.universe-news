## Caldari State

The Caldari State is an authoritarian militaristic nation, founded on the pillars of duty, loyalty, efficiency, and hard work. While not as large a society as that of the Gallente or the Amarr, the state is still universally respected and admired. Its economy is fundamentally sound and its military, despite its smaller size, is fully equal to that of any other empire, thanks to a well-kept fleet packed with cutting-edge technology.

A nation built on corporate capitalism, the Caldari State is run by a group of eight megacorporations who divide territory between themselves, controlling and overseeing nearly every aspect of society. Each corporation comprises of thousands of smaller companies, ranging from industrial companies to law firms. All real estate is owned by the companies, which then lease it to the citizens. Government and policing are also both handled by independent companies funded by each of the megacorporations.
