On the evening of the 14th the State Protectorate Academy was created with the purpose of helping to educate some of our younger militia members.

"The Academy will feature guest lectures by Eve University, the largest and most successful teaching institution in New Eden, as well as lectures by experienced members of the militia."

The academy is open to all militia members.
