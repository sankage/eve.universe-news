**Kishbin** was a CEO of
[Sukuuvestaa Corporation](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB). He disapproved of the
close relationship between [David](3H01yyv6huJ5QjGhvOP55j), the then-CEO of [Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK), and Kand Yonate, the
former CFO of Sukuuvestaa, and worked to demolish both men. In order to
keep the two from releasing a joint project, he demanded David procure
100 units of a rare mineral. David produced 200, further enraging
Kishbin. Eventually, he began making moves to purchase SuVee shares and
eject David from his position, leading David to hide his shares in
shadow accounts. Kishbin then brought corruption charges against the
men, which held weight because of David's shadow accounts. The two men
resigned rather than be formally tried.
