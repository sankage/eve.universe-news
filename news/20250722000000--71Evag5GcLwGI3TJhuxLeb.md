### Beautiful Nightmares: SolarFest Creativity Unleashed
Paragon has hosted an exhibition of ship SKINs created by independent artists to mark their first ever SolarFest. These artistic efforts were just one part of Paragon’s interstellar arts festival, a celebration of creativity in New Eden dedicated to Paragon’s artistic platform SKINR.

Pilots took to the skies in Nightmare-class ships re-coated in glorious colors. Their new SKINs were made by the noted capsuleer designers Alex Tow, Kradick Khan, Sven Bauer, Tyr Raez, and Zoey Kaizar. A product of Sansha’s Nation, the sight of a Nightmare is normally an omen of great fear and horror in New Eden, but these battleships had been reclaimed as beautiful expressions of the artists' talents.

The pilots roamed all across nullsec, beginning in Querious where they were destroyed in an engagement with the resident alliance OnlyFleets. Returning in fresh clones, they headed north to Vale of the Silent and Tribute, where they fought in a protracted skirmish against local capsuleers. After that, they headed west to fight The Initiative in Fountain, then finally east to Etherium Reach, where Pandemic Horde made quick work of the artistic flyers. Watch GalNet’s broadcast for full coverage of the event.

### Inter-Planetary Festival Largest in History
While these beautiful ships engaged amongst the stars, planetary colonies across the cluster hosted musical concerts, engineering showcases, and artistic exhibitions. With events taking place on hundreds of planets, SolarFest is New Eden’s largest ever festival.

On Amarr, Paragon’s IRIS welcomed to the stage acclaimed soloists Ameyn Jural and Louwi Kil. The two were reunited with composer Khitian Maritak for the first time since their legendary performance of the Sarum Symphony fifteen years ago. They performed Maritak’s latest composition, Spectrum Dawn, written for the festival. This sweeping epic honors the many stars that make up the Amarrian Empire.

On a shielded platform amongst the clouds of the storm planet Teonusude II, Ruhste troops convened for a three-day dance competition. Held in partnership with the Vherokior tribe, the “Solar Sail Dance Championship” hosted over a thousand dancers from every tribe of the Republic. IRIS opened the ceremony with a speech dedicated to the history of the art form. quashing false rumors that the poet Crofton had refused to participate in the event.

On Caldari Prime, a joint Gallente-Caldari peace concert was opened by duelling suraiiko players. The concert celebrated the joint history of the Luminaire star system with artists from both of the planet’s major cultures. IRIS joined the players, displaying her own technical brilliance on the suraiiko to the crowd's amazement.

While there are too many events to mention all by name, Paragon’s IRIS told media outlets at the company’s headquarters in Ourapheh that she was “proud to be a part of a corporation that is so dedicated to artists from so many worlds”.
