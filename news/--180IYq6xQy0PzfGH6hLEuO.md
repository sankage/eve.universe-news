# Sanmatar
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/sanmatar

Sanmatar is a traditional title given to the leader of the
**Minmatar**. It means "true Matar". The title was left unfilled for
generations, until [Maleatu Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV)
reinstated it.

While not the official head of state within the republic, the
Sanmatar carries out several functions that normally apply
in states where an individual is head of state. In addition,
in situations where the whole council cannot or will not
attend in its entirety, the Sanmatar acts as the recognized
head of state. As the council rarely meets outside of council
meetings this, in effect, means for much of the time the
Sanmatar is the visible and de facto head of state for the
Minmatar Republic.

Once every two years a Tribal Assembly is held to choose
a Sanmatar (an old Minmatar title of leadership literally
translated as “true Matar”). The Sanmatar presides over all
Tribal Council meetings, acting as a mediator, but carrying no
vote in council decisions. The Sanmatar’s sole official power
is the ability to declare an emergency, during which period
he is granted complete executive control. However, the Tribal
Council can vote by simple majority to end the emergency at
any time, and when they do so, the Sanmatar is removed from
office, unless the council votes by two-thirds majority to retain
the current Sanmatar.
