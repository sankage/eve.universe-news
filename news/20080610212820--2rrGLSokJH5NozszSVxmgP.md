Reports are coming in of widespread anti-Gallente violence in major cities across the State, as vigilante groups raid recently-closed businesses and residences that once housed Federation expatriates. Another eyewitness account has alleged that almost 1,000 State citizens of Gallentean origin on Urlen II also met a violent end at the hands of angry mobs. Conflicting reports state that once news of the Federation invasion broke, the Gallentean-born citizens armed themselves and "started shooting whoever they saw." 

Caldari authorities are believed to be addressing both issues with force. Local officials have claimed that corporate security forces have been deployed. With a complete media access restriction in effect however, very little can be confirmed.
