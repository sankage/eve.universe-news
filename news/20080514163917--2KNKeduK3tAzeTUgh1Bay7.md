Piak – Tibus Heth, the firebrand CEO of Caldari Constructions widely held responsible for inciting racial tensions between the Caldari State and Gallente Federation, released a brief statement endorsing the surprise economic initiative between the Federation President and Ishukone CEO: 

"I welcome Otro Gariushi’s initiative to calm the situation on Caldari Prime, and praise his peaceful approach to managing our relationship with the Gallente Federation. I look forward to hearing the details of this agreement, and wish to contribute to the diplomatic process any way that I can to provide the best possible outcome for the Caldari people." 

The abrupt turnaround in sentiment follows the renewed popularity of Ishukone corporation CEO Otro Gariushi, who has openly denounced Heth and his ideals.
