Ships have **crews**. They can occasionally do without, but crews are the rule rather than the exception.


###Engineers
Engineers are present as crew aboard some vessels, including [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ)-piloted ships. To rise to the rank of Chief Engineer aboard a [battleship](vEsIuJJVnWWgEJ5JKZif7) is considered a major achievement.


### Quartermasters
Quartermasters are present as crew aboard some vessels, including capsuleer-piloted ships.


### Ancillary and exceptional crew
#### Dock-workers
Dock workers are the general workforce present in station docking facilities, where they undertake many labor-intensive task. Though their work is harsh, dock-workers have some opportunities for advancement in the space industries, including crewing aboard spaceships. These workers also become very familiar with the spaceships and people passing through the docks, and are often capable of distinguishing capsuleers from others by sight alone.


####Drone Queens
Drone Queens are believed by many to be the controlling entities of [rogue drone](rogue-drones) hives. The concept of the drone queen controlling a hive of rogue drones is so widespread that it is sometimes used as an analogy for the capsuleer controlling her ship.
