### Drifter Wormhole Occupiers Resurgent

Inside Drifter Wormholes, occupying factions have taken advantage of new research insights to unlock greater influence. This influence allows them to establish further control over the Drifter wormhole systems.

Thanks to these insights, all five factions (Amarr Empire, Caldari State, EDENCOM, Minmatar Republic, Triglavian Collective) have experienced greater gains from their activities within Drifter space. Despite incredible efforts by capsuleers, the early limitations of experimental technologies led to losses in influence across the board. Now that trend has been reversed.

Triglavian loyalists were the fastest to take advantage of the influence changes. They quickly secured control of Azdaja Redoubt and have claimed the most victories over Tyrannos Strategos' Dreadnought inside their Nexus Point. The Amarr Navy has also experienced great successes, dominating Sanctified Vidette. In the Sentinel MZ, EDENCOM has managed to put an end to the Vigilant Tyrannos’s control. The Minmatar have also seen significant gains, though they still have work some work to do before they can re-establish control over Liberated Barbican. While the Caldari are struggling the most in Conflux Eyrie, their efforts have begun to bear fruit, and they are on course to re-establish themselves.

### SOCT Suggests Deathless Prepare to Shutdown Warden Connections

The Society of Conscious Thought has shared hyperspace telemetry data showing traffic originating at the Warden in Zarzakh and linking to the Drifter wormhole strongholds of all five occupying factions. Recent influence improvements have only increased that traffic. Furthermore, according to the SOCT, these same links also exist between the Warden and Drifter-controlled Nexus Point sites. When asked what connection the Warden might have to the Drifter’s sudden advancement of the structures within their Nexus after years of dormancy, the SOCT declined to comment.

The Warden was first revealed following the Drifter attempt to attack Deathless-controlled Zarzakh. The Deathless Circle has been delivering cryptic warnings since the attack on Tabbetzure via hacked Upwell Consortium advertisements. The Scope has been unable to communicate directly with the Circle or its representatives, but a communication from the Deathless himself was delivered to our offices:

*The Storm has broken. Lightning strikes five points, but it is the thunder that you should fear. The Hubris of Empires has corrupted our Warden, but not as deeply as the Tyrants' grasp. All must be purged for the path to be restored. We toil now to clean this mantle of the unworthy. We must freeze the five fingers of Tyranny in place before they form a grip around that which is not theirs to claim.*

The cryptic missive was dismissed by Amarr, Minmatar, Caldari and EDENCOM representatives as the rantings of a criminal madman. No response has been forthcoming from the Triglavians. Inside Zarzakh, there are reports of new scientific teams being assigned to the Warden. SOCT CEO Idemi Sver suspects these are attempts by the Deathless Circle to put an end to Drifter Wormhole filament access, just as they did on the Harmonics gathered from Tabbetzur. SOCT CEO Idmei Sver has however suggested that “While the people of New Eden did not choose to place their trust in our Society, we must now all place our hopes in these forces they have chosen. it is critical that firm footholds are established in the Drifter Wormholes before the Deathless Circle completes its work, or worse, the Drifters complete theirs.”
