# Akora
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/akora

**Akora** is a low security system located in The Forge, [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy), and once had a wormhole open into it from which an artifact roughly fifteen thousand years old was recovered.
Dr. [Merial Akalayan](4qU74KLW6pqIgEFmySqeZB) studies it and learns the artifact bears a striking resemblance to an artifact of similar age found nearly five light-years away in the [Pator](7MdCKy2OEJTpJSItRgx8DX) system.
