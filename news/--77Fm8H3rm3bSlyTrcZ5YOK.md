**Melarius Torvil** is the leader of the [Brothers of Freedom](1CfzDqtAmLd91V2NPTIB76). He is surrounded by a dozen
armed guards at all times. When [Vania](3ywl6lvBzM1gMZuIAbRkQS), his
girlfriend, becomes pregnant he is happy at first, but when he hears
about the congenital defects, knowing how hard it will be for a sick
child to live the life they will be living, he pushes for an abortion.
