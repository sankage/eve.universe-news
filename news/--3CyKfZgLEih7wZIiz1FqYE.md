# Zoriac
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/zoriac

**Zoriac** was [Idonis Ardishapur's](2ZNvkPaPzpj4IaVpL2vWK3) life-long friend, having been raised with him. 

Both he and Idonis had gained an appreciation for [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) culture after moving to [Arzad II](hhT3DOiMGuhLQl0vmNbuY), something that lasted until Idonis's father [Arkon](17tWRlpXtkWqoUBdAdWGxN) was murdered by one of his slaves.

It was Zoriac who advised Idonis that his first move as [Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) would be judged closely, especially in light of his father being murdered. It was this advice that led Idonis to the conclusion that his first act as Royal Heir would be to bombard Arzad II from orbit, destroying all [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) there.
