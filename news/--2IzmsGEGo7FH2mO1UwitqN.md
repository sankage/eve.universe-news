Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/gabri-chican

**Gabri Chican** is a [pod pilot](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) whose profession is mostly mining. He has a habit of giving large, bountiful asteroids female names, and notably did this with an asteroid he called [Theriese](4H8wNZnIqDRowpCuSlERYv). When he approached to mine it, however, he encountered a [rogue drone](3Krc0xwkty10ryEG5apWhG) hive. Though he tried to escape, the drones neutralized his ship's energy and kept him from warping. They then swarmed him and destroyed his ship, though he escaped in his pod, considering himself lucky to be alive.
