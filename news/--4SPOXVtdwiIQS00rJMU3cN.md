# Curse
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/curse

**Curse** is the old home of the [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) Empire. The Jovians departed their home centuries ago after the fall of their Second Empire and set themselves up in their current whereabouts to form the Third (and current) Empire. The cause of the departure was the dreaded [Jovian Disease](23mdEc1035XOWRcmorPJYf), which only Jovians could catch. Having found no cure for the disease the Jovians decided to leave their home worlds in a desperate bid to rid themselves of the disease once and for all. The attempt failed. Today, the former Jovian systems are occupied by the [Angel Cartel](3p6aB4GMbVdMUEVYOb3kF0), the strongest pirate clan in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk). Rumor has it that the source of their power is old Jovian technology scavenged from the relics of old Jovian stations and settlements. The region was also at one time home of Curse Alliance, which was known for its operations against the Cartel.
