# Arkon Ardishapur
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/arkon-ardishapur

**Arkon Ardishapur** was the head of the [Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) who moved their residence to [Arzad II](3GU5GnnzvXqLbJNLd2Otoi) in order to bring the word of the
Amarr Scriptures to his [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) subjects there.

While interrogating three slaves suspected of fomenting rebellion, his
own trusted slave servant - who was secretly involved as well - murdered
him with his scepter to avoid being uncovered, and fled.

Arzad II was bombed by his son [Idonis](2ZNvkPaPzpj4IaVpL2vWK3) in
retaliation, but this failed to diffuse the situation. The scepter,
which had been a symbol of the Emperor's will, became much replicated by
slaves leading up to the [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N) and were known as the Khumaak
in honor of Arkon's killer, [Drupar Maak](4jYB1gA3QgB54Pi5vxP3Em).
