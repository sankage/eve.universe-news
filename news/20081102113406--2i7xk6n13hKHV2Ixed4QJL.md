Aset - The continuing rescue operation at an asteroid mine in the Aset system reported slow progress in their efforts to rescue the trapped mining crews.

According to the Khalial Vik, head of emergency operations for Minmatar Minining Corporation, process through the asteroid has been slow since they began the rescue dig yesterday.  The delays are being caused by the hazardous composition of the shattered asteroid core and, more seriously, intermittent system failures on their drilling equipment.

The teams are looking into the source of the system failures but they remain unable to explain them at the present time.
