The empires have launched a major investigation into the behavior of Concord agents, after it was revealed that contracts had not been fulfilled and many of their clients left without promised gains or in some cases, with actual losses. This revelation has sent shockwaves through the Concord administration and high level agents have already been suspended pending an investigation. No official statements have been issued as of yet, but a high ranking Concord official has stated off-record that "...the guilty will be removed from the ranks of Concord and the pages of history. Concord will prevail."
