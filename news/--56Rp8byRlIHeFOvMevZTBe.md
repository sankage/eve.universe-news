# Sispur Kreal
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/sispur-kreal

**Sispur Kreal** is a [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) boy and a former
inhabitant of [A'Beef](WMBX2Ks93HW71o5i1x2Fx), where he was raised from birth.
During his stay there he was like a younger brother to his friends
[Arbjan Haede](3JGWSFhaNEORp0EvZbaSZa) and [Bryd Krooear](25qQ5l0I6Me0mAkauY7m1G).

Sispur suspected that the many tests used to determine selection of
servants for [Royal Amarr Houses](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) were all fake
and that the selection process was an actual lottery. When both Arbjan
and Bryd were selected, he is separated from his friends and becomes a
loner, shirking his duties and frequently going exploring the colony and
its many empty rooms.

One day shortly after he came across Bryd, lying beaten in a cubby hole.
Bryd explained that he and Arbjan had been forced into unofficial gangs
representing each House and made to fight one another. Rather than fight
his friend, Bryd fled, and had eventually been beaten before managing to
escape a second time. Bryd then told Sispur that the latter had been
chosen to serve [Chamberlain](4cstqCKrXLAu5XDiqztSe6)
[Karsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL). Sispur subsequently left his
friend and was given a wide berth by the other children, before being
taken away to his fate by the guards.
