# Khanid
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/khanid

Among the oldest of the
bloodlines to be assimilated by the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo), the
**Khanid** people have endured the political turmoil of their leaders
with great dignity and calm. Originally fellow settlers alongside the
Amarr on the planet Athra \- known today as [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4)
\- the Khanid were swept up by the nation
of Amarr and the powerful message of their faith during the height of
the original [Reclaiming](70QLNGRwCwHUgmcjTmuhsA). For centuries they
were exalted members of Amarr society, until a bitter feud between the
Empire and an [Amarr heir representing the Khanid](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf)
forced an outright secession of the bloodline's majority, and the
subsequent creation of the independent [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj).
Today, a large Khanid population
remains in Amarr, loyal to the faith and royalty of the Empire. Many of
them yearn for the day when the two kingdoms will reunite. They may not
have that much longer to wait.

### Racial Traits

Long before the Amarr Empire took to the sky, Khanid males were
recognized as the best infantrymen in the Empire. During the Reclaiming,
Khanid warriors were at the forefront of the subjugation of the [Ealur](6TgmS6RKjOYM1Id08VBZzk), the [Ni-Kunni](5zoewV2VJJnYgvWj0Khn1K),
and the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp). Though physical stature and
bravery count for less today than it did then, many Khanid males have
fully embraced the warrior tradition.

Modern Khanid society was shaped by the ancient warrior lifestyle of
their past. The Khanid female tends to be fiercely independent and
resourceful, long accustomed to fending for herself. She backs down from
no one, and is very much the mistress of her own destiny.

### Ancestry

#### Cyber Knights

Many of the Khanid want to keep their warriors competitive, but the only
way to do so in the modern world is through extensive body enhancements.
The advanced knowledge of cyber implants possessed by the Amarr has
proven exceptionally useful in this regard. Some Khanid still aim to
excel in physical combat, while the more progressive ones seek to become
masters of modern warfare.

#### Unionists

A number of Khanid were unhappy with the break from the Amarr Empire.
While they never resorted to armed resistance, they are pleased by the
improving relations with the Empire and hope the two nations will unite
once more. They are eager to do whatever is necessary to achieve this,
including taking on the common enemies of the Empire and the Kingdom.

#### Zealots

The Khanid are not generally known to be as devout as the Amarr, but
those who are tend to be fanatics even by Amarr standards. Religious
Khanid are often inducted into zealous cults, generally based on their
interpretation of the [Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp). The Amarr
regard these religious Khanid with suspicious interest; on the one hand
the cultists' extremism alarms them, but on the other their religious
fervor often results in deep theosophical insights.
