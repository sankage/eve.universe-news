**Eastward Bound** \- Throughout the vastness of space, thousands of elite pilots fly across the starry skies oblivious of the forgotten wonders waiting to be rediscovered. 

Epic monuments, abandoned stations, crumbling ruins, weird and wonderful spacial phenomena, just some of the sights waiting to be seen. 

For those pilots who want to experience something different, for those who are wanting to capture the spirit of adventure and exploration, here is a collection of some of New Edens most important natural, man-made and other mysteriously fabricated landmarks and points of interest. 

Setting off from the remote port of Polaris we will travel in each of the cardinal directions documenting our finds. 

On our final leg of the journey what could possibly surpass what we have seen so far?

**Journeying Into The East**

__Divinity's Edge__

  * In the early stages of Amarr expansion through space they encountered Divinity's Edge - a huge void with little in way of solar systems or other stellar bodies. For a long time they believed this was the end of the galaxy and that beyond this point, nothing existed. Centuries later the Great Wildlands were discovered and this theory was abolished, although the name for the place has remained.

__City Of God__

  * Built by the megalomaniac emperor Zaragram II some 2000 years ago, intended to be the home of the living god, namely himself. Zaragram set out to uproot and eradicate many of the most sacred traditions of the Amarrians, replacing them by his own mad ideas on divinity. He called his city Mezagorm, meaning Vision of God. Eventually, he was assassinated and later emperors, under pressure from the clergy, did their utmost to bury his memory. The ruins of Zaragram's city still exist, haunted by ghosts and pirates.

__The Myridian Strip__

  * Several decades ago the Amarr Empire was desperate to improve their relations with the other empires, mainly to increase trade and tourism. One of the projects they embarked on was to build the Myridian Strip vacation resort, located above the plasma clouds in the Ezzara system. From an aesthetic point of view the location was perfect: stunningly beautiful and exotic. The resort itself was also a wonder of the world and for the first few years of its operation tourists from all over flocked to it. But the location had one fatal flaw, one that was to manifest itself less than 5 years after it opened: it was located too close to Blood Raider space. The Blood Raiders eagerly jumped on the opportunity presented to them on their doorstep and hundreds perished in their initial raid. Not long after the resort was permanently closed and since then only inhabitants it has had are Blood Raiders, reveling in their prized asset.

__Golgothan Fields__

  * The Minmatar Rebellion saw many battles, both on ground and in space. The largest of the space battles took place in the Ennur system a few weeks after the start of the rebellion. The main Amarr battle fleet had returned from Jovian space and intended to break the power of the rebels once and for all by sweeping through their core systems. The Minmatars met the Amarrians with everything they got. The battle was fierce and lasted for hours. In the end the Minmatars withdrew and the Amarrians claimed a victory, but the Minmatars had succeeded in disabling or destroying the best capital ships in the Amarr fleet, thus reducing their offensive strength dramatically. Today the old battlefield, commonly known as Golgothan Fields, is littered with old shipwrecks and infested with pirates that have taken refuge in the giant hulks. They fiercely defend their base, but daring scavengers can still sneak in and rummage around.

__Ginnungagap__

  * Ginnungagap is a huge black hole at the edge of Minmatar space. It is the largest black hole close to civilized space. The black hole has already rendered several solar systems close to it uninhabitable, but otherwise it is not considered to pose any great risk to inhabited space for the foreseeable future. The black hole can be seen very clearly in the Konora system, located very close to it.

__Point Of No Return__

  * Point of no Return is a small black hole located not far from empire space. The black hole is rather old and was formed by a sun only just large enough to create a black hole when it collapsed. One interesting fact about it is that itâ€™s located more or less exactly in the center of the known world, if you only count those systems that have been linked with star gates.

As we head back to Polaris our next installment will reflect on what we have seen and we will have advice for those wanting to experience the life of an explorer and adventurer.
