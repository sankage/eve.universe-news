Vincent Aslo held a third and final instalment of his "Beat The Tank" contest recently, suffering yet another defeat. His opponent this time around was a Deteis pod-pilot by the name of Pearl Charaxes. The reward was two million isk and, of course, the pride of hammering one of the richest men in the Federation.   
  
Though Mr. Aslo has stated that this will be the last round of "Beat The Tank", he hints that a new game, called "Hunt The Bounty", will be even more fun and rewarding. Coming to a system near you, soon!
