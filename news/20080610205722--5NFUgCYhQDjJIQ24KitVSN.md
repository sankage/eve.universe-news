Caldari Prime – Tibus Heth, the dictator whose mercurial rise to power has shocked New Eden, has just raised the flag of the Caldari State over the city of Arcurio on Caldari Prime, in the Gallente Federation capital system of Luminaire. 

The historical act follows a conversation with President Foiritan, in which Tibus allegedly threatened to bomb Gallentean civilians from space, all of whom are segregated from former Caldarian expatriates by President Foiritan’s own decree. Tibus also stated that this action ends nearly two hundred years of Federation "occupation", and that although the path to Gallente Prime was clear, he did not consider it as a "show of good faith". 

Terms of the negotiated "truce" stipulate that Mr. Heth’s sovereignty claim is for the planet of Caldari Prime alone, and not for the system of Luminaire. Although the bulk of Caldari Navy forces are expected to return immediately to Caldari territories, some "military assets" are going to remain over Caldari Prime, although the exact composition of this force is not known at this time.
