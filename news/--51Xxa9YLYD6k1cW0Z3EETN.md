# Skids
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/skids

**Skids**, real name Skidochi, is a [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)
mercenary. She was a firearms expert with a Quickdraw implant that
allowed her to quickly draw and fire her weapon. Skids is noted to be
rebellious, which led to her exile from the Caldari State. She continues
to carry guilt over her inability to properly serve the State.

Her mercenary team was hired to discover the location of [Anvent Eturrer](4ft267N4XjELE5by1uHCt5). Skids was noticeably agitated with
the mission, growing more uncomfortable as it progressed, since the
State considered Eturrer a hero. Her teammates, specifically
[Jeanelle](31qt5S4KiXZpu5ggLHHsNd), noticed her increasing discomfort. Once
Jeanelle managed to discover Eturrer's location, Skids attempted to kill
her to halt the transmission. However, [Asadir](1LI0JW7HmHC7Dey3QEhTuG) had
rigged an EMP device that deactivated Skids's Quickdraw implant, then
Jeanelle activated a [Dead man's switch](3Z5w49e94cXP0OFn0iBBQk)
implant that knocked Skids unconscious. Skids' memory was then wiped to
before the mission, allowing her to forget her guilt over turning in
Eturrer.
