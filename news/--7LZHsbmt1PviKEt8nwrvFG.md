# Girani-Fa
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/girani-fa

**Girani-Fa** is a mineral-rich system located close to the borders of both the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) empires.

Once disputed territory between the two empires, the system remains under Amarr sovereignty, with the Gallente having rights to mine there as long as they sell a fixed amount of minerals to the Amarrians each year at cost price.

The Amarr Empire established a defense complex and industrial works on the planet of Girani-Fa III some years after the Treaty of Girani-Fa was signed.
