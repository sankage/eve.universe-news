# Freighter containment field testing fails. Further testing required.

Weekend testing of the cargo containment software has revealed a flaw with the system and the upgrade will not be deployed tomorrow. While the software worked as intended, the potential release of numerous cargo containers presented navigational hazards in simulations where freighters were destroyed. These hazards slowed or even stopped movement through systems and caused communications delays as Gal-Net became flooded with the sudden appearance of container transponder beacons. CONCORD agents were required to individually disable the transponder beacons, a time consuming and manpower intensive task. 

Anonymous sources are stating this deployment is only temporarily halted, but were not able to give a future deployment date. Further testing is required to resolve communication issues with Gal-Net and remove any navigational hazards.
