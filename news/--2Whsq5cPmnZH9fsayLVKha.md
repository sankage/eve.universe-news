**Charlize** was a former resident of an unnamed space station. Of [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) descent, she lived on the station for the majority of her life, but moved away in her last years. An old acquaintance, experiencing supposed malfunctions with his ocular implant that manifested as spectral images, saw her sitting across from him suddenly in a diner. She conversed briefly with the old man, who believed she must be dead and attempted but failed to flag down the waitress, Madame [Joraa](3pyB8eXdkI5yUVfcf5PgwS).
