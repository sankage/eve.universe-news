In a show of what can only be called dominance, Kor-Azor champion Ecliptical has bested all challengers, winning the day for House Kor-Azor and securing the Emperor's Throne for the peace-loving and diplomatic Doriam Kor-Azor. Spectators of the highly secretive and guarded championship fights are calling this a "stunning and decisive victory," for Doriam Kor-Azor, who, as Emperor, is expected to continue in the path of the late Heideran VII in working to form deeper relationships and ensure peace among the other empires. Further details will be released as they become available.
