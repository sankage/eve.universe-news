# Braea
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/braea

Braea was engaged to [Gerets](2aEWu9u6DutHQk9ovhWiei) before his disfigurement by an orbital bombardment on [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i). Braea still intended to go through with the wedding, even as military publicists trotted them out as tragic symbols of the war, military propaganda to encourage the support of the people. She was at risk of becoming a martyr for duty as her reasons for staying with her fiance changed and he became more distant. Both she and Gerets would have been entirely beholden to the government had it not been for very large donations made in their names by an unnamed [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ).
