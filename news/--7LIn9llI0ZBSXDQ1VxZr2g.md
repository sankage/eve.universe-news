# Quafe+
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/quafe-plus

**Quafe+** was a regional soft drink in development by [Quafe Company](ssPYMESgTyz1rl4fTojD6) under the direction of Gheyr Aillon.
The drink was extremely addictive because of its flavoring agents, which
were created by [Simuel Touvoux](5JMmpSbMGNrKtgkCvBoMe) using
biomass. The agent caused product demand in testing areas to rise by
300% within 12 hours of consumption. However, once it was discovered
that the biomass used in the flavoring agent was created from human
remains recovered by Lost Stars, Inc, production was halted immediately.
