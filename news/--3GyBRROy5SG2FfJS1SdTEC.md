# Traditionalists
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/traditionalists

The **Traditionalists**, a group composed mostly of historians and
archeologists, were involved with the standardization of timekeeping in
[New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk).

When the need for a standardized time throughout New Eden was
identified, they said the only way to go was to base the new calendar as
much as possible on the 24-hour, 365-day calendar favored by early
post-collapse settlers. All the races, especially the
[Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) and the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo), had some data
on the old calendar and by combining the data it could be remade more or
less in its original form.

The Traditionalists focused their lobbying on the politicians of each
faction, which turned out to be a wise choice once it came to light that
the decision would be political in nature. They were opposed by the
[Arithmetics](6EZHhVXjVATis74MVHrO1B), who believed a new calendar
should be founded on a scientific basis. When the final decision was
made aboard the Jovian cruiser Yoiul, the Traditionalists won
comfortably. A day would be divided into 24 hours and the year 365 days
with an additional day every 4 years, the same as the calendar of the
early settlers.
