::: COMMUNIQUE FROM THE OFFICE OF URIAM KADOR, LORD OF HOUSE KADOR AND HEIR TO THE HOLY THRONE OF THE AMARRIAN EMPIRE :::

::: TO ALL 24th IMPERIAL CRUSADE CAPSULEERS :::

"My fellow crusaders, I come to you today as one of you.  A crusader for our faith, a follower of God's righteous cause and the hallowed way of the Empress."

"Many of you have heard of the disaster the Minmatar had in Aset, but I have been vigilant and have discovered some disturbing information and all is not as it seems."

"The disaster in Aset was caused by an Ancient artefact that the miners uncovered.  My most worthy military scholars have anaylsed the information at hand and believe that this artefact has significant strategic value.  We cannot allow it to fall into the Minmatars hands."

 

"Therefore I am issuing a crusade edict to take the system of Aset and hold it while my forces retrieve the device for the good of the Empire.  Aset is deep within enemy held space and the task will not be easy, but I have faith, for we are the chosen of God and nothing is beyond our reach.

For the God and the Empress!  "
