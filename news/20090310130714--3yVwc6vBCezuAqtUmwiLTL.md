SEYLLIN - Panic has further gripped relief convoys in Seyllin after a Federation disaster relief official was overheard dismissing the chances that there will be any survivors from the day side of Seyllin I. According to reports, a voice on the relief command channel said 'they're dead already, they just don't know it yet,' when asked what to do about a number of survivors from Loadcore who were showing signs of acute radiation poisoning.
