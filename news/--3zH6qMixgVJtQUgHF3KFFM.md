# Heart-of-the-Forest
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/heart-of-the-forest

**Heart-of-the-Forest** is one of the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)
spirits.

Heart-of-the-Forest is the spirit of the mighty kresh trees, of things
that are green and growing. The Winds protect her, but often they bring
a temporary pain to her to spare a greater suffering. She is the great
provider for the Caldari, her wood builds and heats their homes, her
game fills their bellies and clothes their skin, and her leaves and
branches hide them from their enemies. She also uses her resources
wisely; everything in the forest serves a purpose, however small.
Heart-of-the-Forest is perhaps the best known teacher among the spirits,
aside from Cold Wind, although she rarely tells anyone anything
directly, preferring to teach by example. She is prominent in Caldari
beliefs about the home and hearth, and part of the reason Caldari tend
to prefer wood in their buildings, especially homes.
