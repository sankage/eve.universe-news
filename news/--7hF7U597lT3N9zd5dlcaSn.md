# Vilinnon
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/vilinnon

**Vilinnon** is a solar system. It is located in
the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and is infamous for being
the site of the Serpent's Coil (formerly Lookout Post 7-0Z), which after
the first [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV) became
a stronghold of the [Serpentis Corporation](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs).

Residents of Vilinnon and the Gallente Federation as a whole try not to
draw attention to its presence. The Federation has adopted a policy of
ignoring the issue, as the Vilinnon system is under-developed and
considered too insignificant to warrant the military effort required to
drive the pirates out. However, the peculiar rock formations at this
location are of great interest to astrophysicists, some of whom
speculate the formations are the result of an ancient experiment. The
presence of the Serpentis prevents further investigation.
