**David** was a CEO of [Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK).

He was heavily involved in the creation of prototype modules and worked closely with [Yonate](6EWutHvfhZLE0KAKiJdTNM), the CFO of [Sukuuvestaa](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB), who was also his lover. The two used their module creation as a form of coded message to each other, each trying to create a more aesthetically pleasing module than the other. [Ruebin](46Sf8a6drmXcf4cWZGYlTw) believes the two were also trying to secretly admit they were lovers to the public with their increasingly flamboyant designs.

The then-CEO of SuVee, [Kishbin](1ZEtRjZqk7lVOjaLdqQ4q1), disapproved of their relationship and worked to undermine them. First, he attempted to block a joint deal between the companies by demanding 100 units of a rare mineral from David. David procured 200, further angering Kishbin. He then tried to buy up shares of KK and eject David from his position, which led David to hiding his shares in shadow accounts. This gave Kishbin the opportunity to frame them for corruption, leading both men to resign from their posts.
