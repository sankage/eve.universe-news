A [Gallente-born](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp), **Kelen Ontbad** was a presidential candidate in the election of early YC117. A renown artist who gained fame by making political events
accessible and engaging to the general public, Ontbad entered political
life himself, gaining significant support during tensions between
Gallente and Minmatar in YC115.

Early Life
----------

Kelen was born in Colelie to Minmatar expatriates of Vherokior heritage in YC79. His career started
at 17 when the senator of his sub-district, a patron of the arts that had noticed his work while touring schools, provided Ontbad space to exhibit his work in a major exhibition. Each piece was an
interpretation of current affairs that attracted widespread critical
praise and entered the media after it served as the catalyst for an
unprecedented level of political engagement from the general population.
Ontbad's name was mentioned in the Gallente Senate as being responsible for "promoting active and responsible political involvement amongst his district's constituency". As his exhibition
wound down he was being invited to speak in schools as a "success story"
who could inspire disaffected and disengaged Gallente youth,
particularly in schools of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Coverage of
these events turned into an examination of the number of expatriate
Minmatar in these regions. Kelen's exhibitions started to showcase the
plight of the lower classes while continuing to act as a critique of
political events in Colelie, the wider Federation and the Minmatar
Republic.

Academic Career
---------------

Ontbad received a scholarship to attend the University of
Caille studying modern art, holography and politics. The university used a number of his installations and
artworks as the centrepieces for public events and Ontbad contributed
regularly to his campus publication, offering his opinions on current
affairs.

Kelen's profile as an artist was brought to wider attention in the
Federation after a proposal for a holographic work of his was contracted
for display in the Algintal Complex, a sprawling parliamentary building
that was being constructed in the Colelie system. It was the unveiling
of this work that led to his frequent association with political
identities, and he spent subsequent years forming close associations
with prominent Gallente who used him as a poster-child for positive
interactions with Minmatar voters.

Political Career
----------------

Kelen Ontbad had been present at the Luminaire Center for Culture and
The Arts in the city of Caille during the attack by lone gunman Gerne
Broteau that claimed 59 lives, including that of
Sebiestor Tribal Chief and former Republic Prime
Minister, [Karin Midular](3KxlNVAeglPj5ZH0sf3U2j). Ontbad had been
sitting in the front row of the inaugural address and, like many others,
had leapt up on hearing the initial explosions around the building at
the beginning of the attack. Images used during Broteau's subsequent
trial also launched Ontbad into the public eye when footage being
reviewed of Midular's fatal injury also captured Kelen's actions. He was
shown pushing people behind him when the shooting began until he himself
was clipped in the shoulder. Two still images were widely circulated -
one depicting Ontbad with arms outstretched to try and shield those
behind him and another as he spun with the force of his own injury.
Requests were made that these images were no longer published as they
were considered in poor taste, but they captured the public's
imagination and catapulted Ontbad's popularity despite his own initial
reluctance to have them used. He would later turn the second image into
a virtual artwork entitled Dance of Integration, where a loop of his
spinning form was juxtaposed amidst Gallente and Matari dancers and
music from a Matari funeral ceremony.

When tensions rose as Minmatar asked for Karin Midular and her shooter
to be turned over to them, Ontbad became a singular voice in the
Algintal constellation, calling for mediation and calm. With an election taking place in his sub-district soon after the Colelie Incident in YC115,
Ontbad's profile meant that he won the senate seat in a landslide.

Current Status
--------------

Ontbad's bid for presidential office in YC117 was distinguished by a
large investment in a digital campaign, inserting his avatar into
virtual environments. His first foray was into the shared creative
entertainment space of Vormwire, a virtual reality experiment popular
amongst Gallente youth that he had already used extensively. He
announced his candidacy in a holorally that involved him later entering
the Vormwire after a speech at the Algintal Complex to illustrate his
campaign further.

After a great deal of success with this event he expanded into other
virtual entertainments. The results were mixed, especially since these
subsequent appearances were often pre-recorded speeches and
presentations instead of live appearances and as a result were
oftentimes forced upon audiences. Ontbad attracted particular criticism
for appearing in the ready room of the violent shooter TACNET,
addressing players about reducing cultural tensions between Minmatar and
Gallente. There was a significant backlash and Ontbad ended up having
his virtual form destroyed by assault rifle fire approximately 7297
times by players protesting political campaigning in a space that they
used for escapism. The endeavour was soon shut down.

Ontbad came in third in the running with 5.1% of the presidential vote
behind the much stronger support for Jacus Roden (54.2%) and Shaileen
Ramnev (39.7%).
