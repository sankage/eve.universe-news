**Klar** is a [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) black ops
soldier. He and his partner [Arek](4VqmV6tXMvMeMSxdJNwFC6) participated in an
operation to extract a [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) war criminal from
his hiding place on a distant world in low sec. He and Arek entered the
war criminal's home and discovered the letter left behind detailing the
booby traps that had been left for any extraction force that would come
for him. Arek read the letter, which explained the early warning system,
underground bunkers, and death trap that would kill the entire town's
population should the war criminal's bunker be opened.

Klar was adamant about going in and killing the war criminal and, faced
with the arrival of enemy forces, Arek ordered him to go in and kill the
war criminal, which he did.
