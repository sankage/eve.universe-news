# Blooding
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/blooding

While not really ritualized, the process of **blooding** is very important to the [Blood Raiders](1HSqsKgCyL5sX6LpBVfElt) and involves monitoring vital signs while their sterilized containers fill up with their donor's blood. Blooding is usually conducted on board the captured ship with equipment moved across for this purpose. Though rare, a crew may be asked to leave in the middle of a blooding with a replacement crew coming to finish the job.
