BREAKING NEWS - The Interstellar Correspondents have received initial reports indicating that the Foundati0n [FDN] alliance is in the process of being disbanded by Lord Maldoror.

It is reported that Lord Maldoror is unhappy with the current state of the alliance and is actively terminating the memberships of [FDN] corporations. As many as twenty of [FDN]'s twenty-six corporations have already been removed today.

According to an internal source, Director Norsey attempted to prevent the disbanding by calling for an emergency executorship vote, but his corporation, Free Space Initiative [.FSI.] was promptly expelled.

We will provide additional information as it becomes available.
