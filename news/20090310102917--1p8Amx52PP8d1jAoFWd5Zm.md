LUMINAIRE 1022 - Share prices in the Gallente mining sector have tumbled dramatically as the situation on the planet Seyllin I is developing into a full-blown crisis. Although virtually no details of the incident are available yet, the market turbulence is expected to increase.

A news bulletin just released by the Garoun Investment Bank says: "Seyllin is a very important system for the Gallente industry. It is clear that some sort of crisis situation is rapidly developing there. Although we cannot yet estimate its severity, we expect the volatility to spread across other market sectors in the Federation".
