Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/auber

**Auber** was Song's father and a [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) slave. Song was born while Auber and Song's mother were still in servitude. For that reason, Auber had told Song only of his [Master's](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) kindness.

Appearing to Song in a vision quest after the latter had grown, Auber told his son of the time he got caught stealing bread, and of the other abuses other Slaves suffered, and how they eventually won their freedom.
