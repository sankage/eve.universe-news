**Place Your Bets**

BIG Games are perhaps the most well known group within the densely packed lotteries and competition market so it should come as little surprise that they will be celebrating the anniversary in style. 

Well known throughout the cluster, BIG are one of the few corporations who have good relations with the main empires, independent factions and mega-corporations. Their many relationships have been cultivated over the years whilst negotiating for advertising and broadcasting rights. This has put them in a unique position. 

For the anniversary lottery, round number 131, they are presenting something not seen before. BIG have managed to secure custom pilot equipment and memorabilia from the majority of their customers. These items will be given away alongside the normal lottery prizes. 

This is an opportunity for pod-pilots, crew members and the general populace to own very rare custom branded equipment from BIG's sponsors, items potentially worth millions in the future. 

Do not delay. Visit BIG Games' [GalNet announcement](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=764361) for more information.
