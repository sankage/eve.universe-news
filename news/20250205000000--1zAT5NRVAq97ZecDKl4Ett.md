### Capsuleer Efforts Lead to Influence Improvements as Crisis Continues

Capsuleers have successfully completed more than 7,000 operations against the Drifters. Thanks to this, military forces are ready to deploy more effective intel as a second wave of Crisis sites has begun to appear. These superior intel networks are bolstered by additional support from the SOCT. 

According to Elder Mentor Matshi Raish, “The Society will be working alongside Amarr, Caldari, Gallente, and Minmatar response teams to purge this threat.” The SOCT has used intel gathered by capsuleers to develop superior hyperspace tracking. These improvements will remove the negative impact of failed operations and boost the positive influence of successful operations.

Of the 7,250 and rising operational successes, the Caldari State has shown the greatest number of triumphs against the Drifters so far. Chairman Akimaka Saraki commended capsuleers for their support, citing a “tradition of discipline and strong understanding of duty” as the reason for their rapid responses.

By contrast, Minmatar Republic citizens have suffered as their military forces were caught off guard. Clan commons have been targeted by Destructive Scrutinizers which use intensive radiation to visit a variety of nightmarish conditions on those trapped inside. The climbing death toll from these attacks has been a grim reminder of the Drifters' destructive capabilities.

In anticipation of a repeat of these tragedies, clans people in the newly targeted systems of Nein, Geffur, and Hadozeko have begun to flee. This unplanned exodus has resulted in confusion and put more pressure on emergency services. Many more, however, refuse to give up their homes. A clan chief based in Hadozeko told the Scope, “For generations we have fought the greedy advances of the damn Imperials, we are not going to roll over now and give away our homes to these monsters without a hell of a fight.” Hetman General Kanth Filmir, who is responsible for overseeing Tribal Liberation Force activities in the system, has called on capsuleers to “aid in the defense of our clans, and join the work already being done to push back Drifter forces.”

Another system caught in the second wave of the Drifter Crisis is Tash-Murkon, the home system of the Royal House of the same name. This Amarrian system was the birthplace of Empress Catiz I herself. In a public statement, the Empress declared, "We Amarr are one in the eyes of the Lord, and there is no system our military service people would not die to defend. We must all band together to support every system under attack." Sources inside the imperial palace have reported that despite this statement of equal support, the Empress has begun attending every military briefing regarding Tash-Murkon in person. Throughout the Royal Houses concerns have been loudly shared over how the Empress will react should her childhood home fall victim to continued Drifter attacks.
