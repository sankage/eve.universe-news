Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/kirion

Kirion was an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
[Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) involved in the [Omicron Incident](6DrNULs5fhn08ajtKLHiqc). He was tricked into believing
his rival, [Hurid-Akan](2r9xQ4PXX5AiOYRdVw9sZn), was planning on having
him assassinated. When he was informed by [the Broker](35XiT6V98vAeV9AdpZyl72) that Hurid-Akan was purchasing
[Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) weapons, he in turn purchased
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) weapons. As open war broke out between
the two Holders, the [Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) was forced to
send a royal arbitrator to calm things down. By that time, both Holders
had already spent their fortunes on weapons.
