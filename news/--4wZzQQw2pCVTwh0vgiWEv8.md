# Dropship
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/dropship

**Dropships** are a class of starship that can land on planets and
operate in atmospheric conditions. The largest dropships are military
variants capable of delivering infantry and armored vehicles to surface
combat zones.

Use and limitations
-------------------

These ships can only warp for short distances, cannot mount standard
starship weapons, and cannot use [stargates](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk). They
are transported across interstellar distances by carrier-class or higher
ships. Dropships can be armed with anti-dropship, anti-aircraft, and
anti-armor ground suppression weapons platforms.

They use [fusion](50ccQDKYOFOFmw0RqFCRmR)-generated thrust for
takeoff and landing. [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk)
interstellar vessels as they exist today cannot perform surface
landings, and the largest dropship class is no bigger than a
[cruiser](3wE5sDRggwgYjiExdCRyL0).
