## Sansha's Nation

There are many horrors along the fringes and in the dark places of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), but few of these are as feared as Sansha’s Nation. The existence of the Nation is a testament to the dark possibilities of technology and the will of one man, Sansha Kuvakei. The genius of Sansha founded and sustained the Nation, but his vision of an intellectual elite served by cybernetically dominated slaves led to its downfall. Yet, for all that they tried to scrub out the stain of Sansha’s Nation, the empires failed and the dream lived on. Slowly but implacably, Sansha’s Nation rose again.

For a hundred years, the Nation was little more than a presence haunting the space lanes and remote corners of New Eden, but now they are once more a force to be reckoned with. Sansha Kuvakei himself, believed dead for decades, has returned and reclaimed his place at the head of the cybernetic legions of the Nation. The old empires see the incursions by Sansha’s fleets and True Slave soldiers, and they see a threat that could destroy them. So grave is this threat that they must call on the double-edged sword of the capsuleer to help throw back the invading servants of their old enemy.
