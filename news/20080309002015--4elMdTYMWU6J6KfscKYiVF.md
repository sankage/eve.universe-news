**Group A**

Molotov Coalition and The Kadeshi will move on from this group to the match tournament. Molotov Coalition won this group handily with 504 points and a 3-1 win/loss record. On the final day of group competition second place was still in question as The Star Fraction and The Kadeshi took to the battlefield to decide who would get to move on. In the end The Kadeshi lost points, but won the war to move on to the final day of the tournament. Blood Blind, a pirate alliance, and When Fat Kids Attack, an alliance that was founded only two months ago, rounded out this group. The team captain of Star Fraction, Bacchanalian has put together a comprehensive report of his alliance's participation in this years tournament.

**Group B**

Green Alliance and Notoriety Alliance will move on from this group to the match tournament. On the final day they fought an epic battle which Noteriety Alliance won, but Green Alliance edged them out for the group’s top spot by three points. Hydra, a member of the Northern Coalition of Alliances, SynchrOnicity, a band of pirates operating in the Derelik region and Smash Alliance (who forfeited their final match) were the other members of this group.

**Group C**

Cry Havoc. and Pandemic Legion will move on from this group to the match tournament. The final day began with Pandemic Legion in the lead, but they had already completed their four group matches for the tournament. Whether or not they moved on to match play was to be determined by a match between Ethereal Dawn and Cry Havoc. Fortunately for them Cry Havoc. came away with a win that put them in first place in the group and it was decisive enough to knock Ethereal Dawn to third place. Mercenary Coalition, who recently took over Period Basis, and Brutally Clever Empire, one of the top ten alliances (in number of members) were the other two members of the group.

**Group D**

Cosa Nostra. and Phalanx Alliance will move on from this group to the match tournament. While Cosa Nostra. is one of the smallest alliances in the tournament they came away with the second highest point total (550)--an impressive showing indeed. On the final day Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate had a chance to move up into second place in the group but they were knocked out by Phalanx Alliance. The Crimson Federation, based out of Devoid, and Blade were in this group as well.

**Group E**

Triumvirate. and The Fourth District will move on from this group to the match tournament. Triumvirate. was powerful in its matches scoring a perfect 4 and 0 record. On the final day of group play The Church alliance had a chance to move up into second place but was beaten back by the Caldari loyalists of The Fourth District who have performed well this year. Exa Nation (1-3 in the group tournament), and United Corporations Against Macros (0-4) rounded out this group.

**Group F**

Ev0ke and Divine 0rder will move on from this group to the match tournament. This outcome was certain when the day started but the two battled over who would battle who for their first match in tomorrow’s tournament action. Ev0ke won the battle on points and will face The Fourth District in their first battle, while Divine 0rder will face Triumvirate. The Five, which originally consisted of former members of Curse Alliance, DeStInY, who claims the northern part of Deklein and Atlas Alliance (a 700 member alliance) were also in this Group.

**Group G**

United Legion and HUN Reloaded will move on from this group to the match tournament. United Legion distinguished itself by scoring the highest point total (575) in the group portion of the tournament. The final day of group battles featured an exciting match between HUN Reloaded and Nebula Rasa to see who would move on. HUN won the match, and so the reigning champions will once again be in the final 16. GoonSwarm, who only learned they would be in the tournament two days before it began, and RONA Alliance rounded out this group.

**Group H**

eXceed. and KIA Alliance will move on from this group to the match tournament. Both squads won the right to move on with eXceed. beating Ushra’Khan and KIA Alliance winning decisively over ROADKILL. This group was beyond doubt one of the most competitive in the group portion of the tournament with every team scoring at least 135+ points. Morsus Mihi, was the remaining member of this group, did not perform up to expectations, but they did score 190 points.
