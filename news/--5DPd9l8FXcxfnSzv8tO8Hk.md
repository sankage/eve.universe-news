Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/lucretio-kor-azor

Lucretio Kor-Azor (born YC 13) is an [Amarr Royal](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh)
[Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) and a member of the [Kor-Azor Family](1S0FEGgzJiwc4yXaG5AzjD).
He is a distant cousin of the current Kor-Azor Heir,
[Aritcio](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV). His branch of the family rules
over Nimedaz constellation of the Kor-Azor region, where they draw
wealth from a variety of sources. He has recently achieved fame for
spearheading the development of a revolutionary polymer synthesis
technique.

Early Life
----------

Lucretio was born in YC13. As a member of the Kor-Azor Family, he was
born into luxury and prestige. He was taught by the best tutors and
groomed for leadership by his family. While his father was only a
distant cousin of the then-current Heir, [Doriam Kor-Azor](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT),
it was hoped that Lucretio would
display enough skill to be made the Heir once Doriam's time had passed.

For a while, it seemed that Lucretio may have had a chance at it. He was
quite shrewd in his dealings and had an eye for talent. He surrounded
himself with the best and brightest administrators and priests in the
region. His business deals were quite successful, particularly in
scientific interests. However, he also gained the reputation as a
micro-manager and a glory-hound, which did not sit well with some
members of the family.

The true impediment to his rise was Aritcio, the son of Doriam. It was
considered well-known amongst the family that Doriam wore blinders when
it came to his son, seeing only his positives and none of his many
negatives. Despite some internal pressure on Doriam to name another
member of the family to succeed him, this never came to pass.

Royal Holder
------------

Instead, Lucretio took over the titles and domains of his father when he
passed in YC 78. The Nimedaz constellation was one of the safer and more
prosperous constellations in the Kor-Azor region, allowing Lucretio the
ability to focus further on business instead of safety. He threw much of
his energy into several tech companies, using his keen eye to select
underlings and projects guaranteed to bear fruit.

One of his greatest accomplishments was the identification of [Darmad Intajaf](1j47229ihLCvpUcYuVUKft), a [slave](slavery) owned
by one of his subservient Holders. Darmad was the son of a religious
researcher and had grown in an academic background, but was sent to work
in the fields by his Holder. Upon hearing about the intelligent young
man in YC95, Lucretio purchased him and sent him to a proper education
at [Hedion University](32yJYVHiayBqLEZq4ulJrd).

Once Darmad had graduated, he was sent to work in a research facility
funded by Lucretio. At first, gains were few, but in
[YC110](4s7KrRaqQANTatQhzlSaRi), Darmad proved his usefulness by leading
the development of a new polymer synthesis technique hoped to
revolutionize high altitude construction. Lucretio, as the financial
backer, was the owner to the patents on the technique, and leveraged
them into several gains for himself.

Since then, Lucretio has further invested the wealth that came from the
new patent into several new projects, including several space ship
projects that appear to be nearing completion.
