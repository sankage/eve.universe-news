With news that a CreoDron research team is planning to enter a stable wormhole, CONCORD has once again issued a warning intended to discourage others from attempting the same.  
  
The entire statement can be found below: "CONCORD reminds all residents of New Eden that entering into these wormholes is highly dangerous. Sufficient testing has not yet been carried out on the wormholes, and their enduring stability cannot be guaranteed. In addition, it cannot be determined what potential dangers are present on the other side. Anyone who travels through [the wormholes] risks being stranded on the other side with no way back. Anyone traveling into these wormholes does so at extreme risk to themselves."
