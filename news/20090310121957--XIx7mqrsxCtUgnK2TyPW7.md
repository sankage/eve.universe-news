PATOR - Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor has disclosed that a Minmatar Republic search effort for the Thukker caravan missing in Great Wildlands is underway in co-operation with the Thukker Tribe. "We have sent all the Fleet search and rescue vessels we have available to the Great Wildlands," said Sanmatar Shakor. "However, much of the patrol capacity is tied up with immigrant convoys, trade missions and border duties. We also have considerable call on our medical and aid capacity at home with the immigrant population. Regrettably, our ability to respond to the appalling tragedy of Seyllin is minimal while we divert all resources to the Caravan search."  
  
"The search for our Thukker brothers must be our top priority at this time." concluded the Sanmatar.
