# Wooden Star
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/wooden-star

The **wooden star** is a device the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) use
when engaging in torture. Like the torture itself, it is a basic device
that has little history and no real personality. The device is shaped
like a star and has very sharp points. It has been used, and presumably
still is, by [Malachai](4uQaHhOH6Vnaro0QOYI8wB), a torturer to whom Song
was apprenticed.
