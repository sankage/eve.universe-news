# Konrakas
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/konrakas

**Konrakas** is a mineral-rich planet in the
[Shintaht](6hdH1UnLE6P8A7ckIJqUzG) system, near [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
space. The planet has an extremely chaotic climate, with seasons ranging
from scorchingly hot to icily cold. Ocean tides are dramatic and floods
are common, winds frequently reach hurricane speeds, and gravitational
forces cause constant earthquakes and volcano eruptions. The planet is
completely lifeless. However, the natural forces constantly force rare,
valuable minerals to the surface, making it a mineral heaven. The same
forces make it difficult to mine, so it has yet to be colonized for
mining.
