The docks at MN5N-X VII - Moon 5 - ArchAngels Assembly Plant have had some problems with the gravity-generating mechanism recently. The situation got out of control earlier today when the system failed as a cargo of livestock was being unloaded leaving the poor animals floating helplessly in zero gravity. Docking operators are working on removing the animals from the facilities and ships will be unable to undock until the job is done. Pilots are advised to stay away from MN5N-X VII - Moon 5 until the situation has been resolved or risk being stuck there for some time.
