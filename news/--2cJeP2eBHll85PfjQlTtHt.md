# Universal Time
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/universal-time

The standard of **Universal Time** (also known as *EVE Standard Time*) is the scientific measure of time used throughout [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk). It is a relatively recent invention, having been agreed upon during the Yoiul Conference. The official time is kept on board the [SCC](secure-commerce-commission) headquarters station in Yulai, using a high precision atomic clock.

Measurement
-----------

Even prior to the Yoiul Conference, all races throughout New Eden used
the same basic units of measurement for time. A second was generally the
smallest unit in every-day usage, with 60 seconds making up one minute.
That is where the similarities ended, however, as each race divided
their days into a different numbers of hours based on the rotation
period of their home world, and then divided the hours into equal
numbers of minutes. Similarly, months and years were divided unequally
based on orbital period, seasonal changes, and local convention.

The current, widely-used calendar as mandated by interstellar treaty
calls for 60 minutes to compose an hour, a single day to be constructed
of 24 hours, a week to consist of 7 days, and a year to be comprised of
365 days. There are 12 months within a year, each containing between 28
and 31 days.

Establishment
-------------

Prior to the Yoiul Conference, each empire used its own time-keeping
method, typically based off the rotation and orbital period of their
home planet. This obviously caused much confusion in trade, travel, and
other enterprises, prompting the creation of one single calendar to the
top of the agenda in peace negotiations.

Three different methods of time-keeping were established. The
[Arithmetics](6EZHhVXjVATis74MVHrO1B) wanted to use a calendar based off
mathematical measurements of the galaxy's rotation, with even the second
redefined into scientific notational standards. The
[25ers](3XtdtI2Z8UIELt1J3aaGsh) pointed to (now discredited) studies of the
human internal clock which said a 25-hour day was most optimal. The
final group, the [Traditionalists](3GyBRROy5SG2FfJS1SdTEC), wished
to use historical calendars they claimed were based on early settlements
throughout New Eden.

In the end, it was the Traditionalists who prevailed, thanks to their
strategy of lobbying politicians directly. The calendar proposed was
reconstructed from fragmentary data recovered from early records, such
as the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) [Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp) and
information provided by the [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G). This decision was
not without controversy, though later studies of the human biological
clock proved that it matched the 24-hour cycle neatly.

After the establishment of Universal Time, the recording of years was
begun at YC 0. Years prior to YC 0 traditionally count down from 23236
AD, based on extrapolation from old records used to construct the
current calendar. A recent scientific push has called for dates prior to
YC 0 to either count into negatives (ie. YC -10) or to count backwards
using BYC as the notation (ie. BYC 10). However, no public traction has
been gained to adjust the laws already in place.

Alternative Calendars
---------------------

While Universal Time is ubiquitous for space-based operations,
particularly for [capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) and interstellar
trade, inhabited planets, especially those with little external contact,
typically base their calendars on old methods. Some space stations in
orbit around planets make use of the planet's calendar in additional to
Universal Time to easily facilitate travel and trade.

Each empire also continues to maintain their old calendars, primarily
for historical and traditional reasons. These calendars are primarily
used for religious holidays; the Amarr staunchly follow the calendar
laid out in the Scriptures for religious observances, for example.
Conversely, the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) have mostly adopted
Universal Time for reckoning the dates of their tribal rituals.
