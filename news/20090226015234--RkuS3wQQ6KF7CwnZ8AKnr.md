**Metropolis** \- 22 nd February 111. The Interstellar Racing Championship (ISRC) kicked off Season 7 with an exhibition event teaming veteran racers with rookies.

As an exhibition event, racers did not race with their regular teams and were restricted to tech 1 frigate class vessels. The organiser for this race **_Catherine 'Quintrala' Delorois_** , had the final decision on whether a racer was considered a rookie or veteran.

Once the teams had been sorted, the race began at the Aliastra Retail Center Station in Hek, continuing through 13 different systems including several non-Concord policed systems.

The racers were doing well and managing to evade the lawless elements of most systems with either little or no damage until the rookie pilot **_Kira Storm_** lost her Condor at the 9th waypoint (she eventually retrieved a replacement and finished the race).

The winning team consisted of **_Cai Lun_** (rookie) and **_Kazuo Ishiguro_** (veteran). Cai said after the race, 'We were pretty happy about it, even with the mistakes we made'. Asked if he would be racing with an established team this season, 'Not sure about that, after racing as a independent racer last season, I was thinking of joining up [with one] of the established teams this season, but nothing is set yet.'

The full results are:

1:24:42 - rookie **_Cai Lun_** & veteran **_Kazuo Ishiguro_** (1:23:43 + 5:00 penalty)  
1:28:28 - rookie _**Dracoknight**_ & veteran **_Takashi Kurosawa_** (1:24:32)  
1:28:38 - rookie **_Bloodpetal_** & veteran **_Kayleigh Jamieson_** (1:26:50)  
2:06:54 - rookie **_Kira Storm_** & veteran **_NeonFolf_** (2:01:01)

The first full league race is scheduled for Sunday 1st March 111 at 20:00 hours.
