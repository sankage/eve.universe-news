# Gallente Federation
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/gallente

## Overview
The Gallenteans. Self-righteous, meddling, pompous and tiresome, or virile liberalists and defenders of the free world. Love them or hate them, you simply can't ignore them. Everybody has an opinion on the Gallente Federation, it all depends from which side of the table you view them. For many, it is the Promised Land, where any dream can become a reality. Descendants of ancient Tau Ceti colonists, the Gallenteans remain strong believers in free will and human rights, despite numerous setbacks in their long history.

It has been said that, once you have seen the [Crystal Boulevard](45ZcfxzqF7v2mqmLksGxYU) in Caille you've seen it all.
True, the view is spectacular, but if there's one thing you can never
see in its entirety, that is the Gallente Federation. You may travel its
length and breadth, marvel at the Sunspiral on Troux, climb the Akat
Mountains on tropical Intaki or thrill to the Mendre dancers on
[Sovicou](3bFH4a0UeEG2PRs7vkKcBu). Wherever you go, you will always see
something new and exciting, even when you visit the same place again.
Gallente society is in a constant state of flux, vigorous, vibrant and
progressive.

Few societies display such stark contrasts. Many of the wealthiest people in the world are Gallenteans, creating a constant demand for luxury goods. At the same time, the ranks of the poor number millions, because while the liberal market-driven economy and individual freedom may allow everybody the chance to advance to the top, they make it just as easy to plummet to the very bottom of the social ladder.

In the world of EVE, the Gallentean are the kings of entertainment, mass-producing everything from cheap porn-flicks to elaborate stage-shows for an ever-hungry public. They boast the most elaborate luxury space yachts, and the most glittering hotel reservoirs. Anything your mind or body could ever crave, the Gallenteans have plenty of it.
