Ms Vahlsina [ sought the aid of her government ](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=637362&page=1#6 ) after she accused CONCORD of ignoring her own efforts for information regarding the fate of her missing partner, Captain Bethol Jan Kozer. 

Following the official intervention of the Gallente Federation representatives to CONCORD, The Inner Circle issued the following short response. 

“We thank the Gallente Federation representative for their official request for information. We will take this request under consideration.” 

Both the Gallente representative dealing with this case, and Ms Vahlsina herself were unavailable for comment on this development.
