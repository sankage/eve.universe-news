# Single-Man Fighters
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/single-man-fighters

**Single-man fighters** were used by the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)
in the Gallente-Caldari War to counter Gallente
[orbital bombers](2DkDo7hofFa5A9hWWPmXEc). The
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) used [drones](3o5QhCbx71nILKNnW9S7v1)
against them.

Though no longer dominant on the battlefield, they continue to see use
by carrier and supercarrier pilots.
