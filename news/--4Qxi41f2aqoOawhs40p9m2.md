# Jita IV - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/jita-iv-moon-4-caldari-navy-assembly-plant

**Jita IV - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant**, or **Jita 4-4** for
short, is a space station and one of the busiest hubs in the entire
cluster, particularly for [capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ).

Construction
------------

The station is made of steel from [Caldari Steel](6DUwl5g8rmIHMWrF9c7N8w). It has an intentionally gray color
scheme, and Terminal 1, one of the docking areas, has concrete walls.

There are numerous corridors that run through the station, even near the
bottom, close to the edge of space. Walls have loudspeakers embedded
into them. Ventilation ducts provide warm air throughout the station;
near the bottom, it appears the air is given out only in occasional
gusts.

Terminal 1
----------

Terminal 1 is one of the main docking areas and looks out on the
constant stream of capsuleer traffic. It has lots of empty space
dominated by bars, vending machines, and VR booths. The primary food
court is gigantic, equal to the size of four [Mind Clash](22qTwYMQWYFPScEBt16DVA) arenas. It is right near the entrance and houses thousands of different eating establishments, from the
low-quality [Quafe](7AX2o1TfJkN853SBNTsEmD) eateries (such as QuafeSnacks) to
high class restaurants (such as Dieurelli). The terminal has tables and
ledges near the numerous elevators, escalators, walkways, and in large
waiting rooms where people mill about.

Notable Establishments
----------------------

QuafeSnacks is a low-quality fast food kiosk that serves cheap fare. It
does not have tables or chairs, requiring consumers to eat their meals
elsewhere. Their bags have [holoprojectors](3R2yaSdkUb08ifof3FfTZd) in
them that constantly emit a billboard with the QuafeSnacks logo on it,
along with various tickers. There are two slightly higher-quality
QuafeSnacks brands: QuafeSnacks Premium and QuafeSnacks Ultra Premium.

Quafe Deluxe, Quafe Deluxe Premium, and Quafe Elite are progressively
higher quality restaurants.

Pmokka Caravan Delights is a [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)-themed
restaurant that serves traditional Minmatar food. It is not a high-class
establishment, but rather sits at a corner deeper into the food court
web. You can get Salted [Amarr Rockjaw](1AytIEkcFkxiuyntgIm127) seared
over a Khari oven and served with Pator Steak here.

Dieurelli is a fancy [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) restaurant that
serves, among other things, Salted Amarr Rockjaw with a side of [Achuran songbird](3GZSwDdSS0nwbIpXJjVomo). It sits in the high-rollers'
mezzanine where the rich congregate.

Security
--------

All visitors to the station are issued a Temporary Station ID. This ID
allows station security to constantly monitor visitors and keep track of
them. [Otro Gariushi's](5QydCJCoYvbvbWvFlAlbHg) ID was \#19.

Sleeping is not allowed in Terminal 1 and, presumably, any other public
location on the station. A first offense only gets a warning. After a
warning, falling asleep for less than 10 minutes assesses a second
warning. Falling asleep for more than 10 minutes, or receiving a third
warning, results in a charge of vagrancy and removal from the area.

Station security is allowed to kill intruders on sight when they are
outside their designated areas.

Other areas
-----------

Near the bottom of the station there is a secret area dominated by [Sani Sabik](TDJbDXVg3cRp4b6FEkkFS) associates, some of whom may be
capsuleers.
