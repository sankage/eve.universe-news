Caldari Prime – The Federation Navy has abandoned its attempts to break the Caldari Navy’s blockade in Luminaire and is reportedly deploying "all spaceborne military assets" to the isolated Caldari system of Tierijev. This report follows confirmation that millions of Caldari troops supported by armor, MTACs, and gunships have launched frontal assaults on the two largest cities of Tovil and Arcurio. Although some pockets of Federation police and marines are fighting back, it appears that the vast majority of defenses in both of these cities was obliterated during the bombardment. 

Civilian casualty reports remain varied, as the bulk of Caldari citizens remain largely isolated because of President Foiritan’s efforts to quell civil unrest in the past several weeks.
