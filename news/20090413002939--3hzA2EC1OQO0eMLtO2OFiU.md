 **8K-CHA, GEMINATE** \- Wildly Inappropriate [WI] has confirmed a full scale invasion of Geminate, initiated on 07.4.111, is underway. The news follows weeks of increased [WI] activity and invasion rumors in the Geminate region.  
  
Reports from the region indicate that [WI] successfully uprooted Idle Empire [IDLE] from the area within forty-eight hours and are currently targeting Ethereal Dawn's [ED] control towers in the 8K-CHA constellation as well as United Freeman Alliance [UFA] fleets. Currently [ED]'s sovereignty has dropped in three of 8K-CHA's seven systems.  
  
"As a growing alliance our goal is to expand to a more reasonable sized area of operation than our current holdings in Branch," stated [WI] diplomat Tomcat. "...being our first offensive operation as an alliance, this also creates a public identity for [WI] and what we can be capable of. This also allows us a more strategic beach-head for longer term pvp operations."  
  
The attack on [ED] space in Geminate coincides with Majesta Empire's (also a Northern Coalition alliance) assault on [ED] control towers in the LS-JEP system in Vale of the Silent. Both attacks have garnered little resistance from [ED] according to [WI]. "The space is not much value to us at all," emphasized [ED] CEO Ralian Gelian. "LS-JEP is pretty useless space aside from the cosmos constellation next door."  
  
According to Gelian there has been little concern for the area given that "we have much bigger targets to focus on." Ethereal Dawn and sister alliance Intrepid Crossing [IRC] are currently engaged in a fierce conflict with Red Alliance [RA] and several smaller factions in both Etherium Reach and Insmother. Gelian believes the Northern Coalition attacks are intended to "pull us off our current campaign vs [RA], which really hasn't slowed us down much at all."  
  
It is unknown as to where the [WI] invasion armada will turn once the mostly uncontested invasion of 8K-CHA concludes.  
  
Analysts have already recognized that the fall of 8K-CHA allows for direct, conventional access to NK-AOZ - the larger of [UFA]'s two constellations. While [WI] is keeping all information concerning the potential for an invasion of NK-AOZ classified, the possibility certainly exists given the moderate amount of fighting taking place between [WI] and [UFA]. Last week's battles leaned in [WI]'s favor with the destruction of three [UFA] carriers.  
  
At this moment Tomcat believes the majority of [UFA]'s fleet has been "pinned down" in the K25-XD system of NK-AOZ - their sole station system in Geminate.  
  
"The thought that first comes to mind is 'as planned'," stated Tomcat when asked to speculate on the invasion's outcome. "Everything thus far has been executed perfectly ...everything is right on schedule."  
  
[UFA] is taking a wait-and-see approach to the conflict and indicated they were aware of the impending invasion well in advance. According to Gendril, a [UFA] CEO, no [UFA] towers have been aggressed and any losses sustained up to this point have been insignificant. However, he noted that [WI]'s numerical advantage has been a factor.  
  
Attempts to contact [IDLE] for a statement were unsuccesful.
