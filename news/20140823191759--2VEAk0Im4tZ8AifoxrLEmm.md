After a [furious first weekend](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/eve-online-news/alliance-tournament-xii-review-of-the-first-weekend/) with thrilling fights and some spectacular matches, the second weekend of the [Alliance Tournament XII](http://community.eveonline.com/community/alliance-tournament/) organized by CCP is about to kick off with teams already fighting against elimination from the tournament.

As the Alliance Tournament is a double elimination tournament, each team can lose up to one match, but the second lost match leads then to instant elimination (except for the semifinals and finals, they are best-of-three and best-of-five matches).  During the first weekend we saw teams getting sorted into the losers bracket (one match lost) or remaining in the winners bracket (no match lost), but from now on it is all-or-nothing for the 32 teams in the losers bracket.

During this second tournament weekend on August 23rd  and 24th we will see action packed matches between some of the finest and most renowned alliances to be found in EVE Online giving their best to win. The Alliance Tournament spans in total over the course of four weekends.

All matches of the Alliance Tournament will be broadcasted and commented live by our tournament experts on the [CCP Twitch.tv channel](http://www.twitch.tv/ccp); the free broadcast begins on August 23rd and 24th at 15:00 UTC - don't miss it!
