# Sleeping Gas
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/sleeping-gas

**Sleeping gas** has been used in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) on occasion. As one might imagine,
it is particularly effective on [stations](2qtjPWHmmUS1ochdVGMFx1)
and other orbitals where, despite stringent controls over air supply,
the enclosed oxygenated environments make the gas that much easier to
employ effectively.

A notable use of sleeping gas was where it was employed in the
kidnapping and ransom of Ambassador [Luecin Rileau](2d24moamL2NaimjLpHTENT). The founders of the
[Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO), two men who called themselves [Fatal](2cUo2UbsCruVr7VsIHmw1N) and [the Rabbit](3Mb6UfjhKf0MdSbbR4a2EU), employed the gas at the boarding
ramps of Rileau's ship, and in one fell swoop dropped him and all his
bodyguards.
