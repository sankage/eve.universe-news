_Piak - _[Caldari Constructions](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Constructions) stock saw an uptick following reports that it has broken even on operations for the first time in four years. The corporation had been posting small losses under the executorship of [Tibus Heth](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth) which, while not as significant as those of [Kaalakiota Corporation](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kaalakiota Corporation), had still put stress on the company.

Following the report, Caldari Constructions also released a statement saying it has completed the nullification of Tibus Heth's stake in the company and will begin a public offering on his reclaimed shares. The sudden availability of the large number of shares is expected to stall, or even reverse, the gain, but analysts also expect this to be a short term dip in an anticipated upward trend of Caldari Constructions shares.

Finally, the corporation has indicated it will initiate a leadership vote for a new CEO pending the public offering. Several upper level executives with the corporation are considered top candidates, including CFO Tamo Heinulaila, Business Development Director Onnuta Ahvala, and CMO Korada Shutsu.
