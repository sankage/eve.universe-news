# Pettokori
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/pettokori

**Pettokori** is a popular electro-board gambling game.

[Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) founder [Fatal](2cUo2UbsCruVr7VsIHmw1N) once deliberately lost a game of
Pettokori badly to then-ambassador to the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) [Luecin Rileau](2d24moamL2NaimjLpHTENT), gambling away his ship to the
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) diplomat. In reality it was all a part
of a kidnapping scheme which granted Fatal and [the Rabbit](3Mb6UfjhKf0MdSbbR4a2EU) tremendous fame.
