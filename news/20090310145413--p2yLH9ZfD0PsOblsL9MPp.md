SEYLLIN - A distress call from a Serpentis freighter stranded in Seyllin has reached the blockades surrounding the system. According to sources, a mechanical failure dropped the vessel out of warp before it could reach the nearest stargate. After a partial repair of the drive, its captain attempted to return to Seyllin I rather than warp out of the system. In a voice transcript of the distress call, the Serpentis captain states "To anyone who's listening, Seyllin's not there anymore. You hear me? Seyllin-one is gone, do not attempt to approach..."  
  
The transmission stops after that. No additional information is available as CONCORD and the Federation Navy continue to maintain a blockade of the system.
