Open warfare has been declared between the old established Stain-alliance and the newly formed Curse-alliance (which includes corporations that have fought the SA in one form or another before). All pilots are warned that members of both alliances have threatened to shoot at any and all ships within their range for the duration of the war.   
  
Allegedly, some large battles have taken place with casualties on both sides. Reports are vague as the area is obviously a challenge for correspondents to enter.
