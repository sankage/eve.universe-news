The rescue team searching for Dresen Karnell on a habitable moon in Huola reports no success in locating him. The lake discovered by orbital scanning has been revealed to have a salinity fatal to humans if ingested. Karnell's remains were not discovered, indicating that he is still alive.

The rescue team plans on following the stream feeding the lake, reasoning that Karnell would seek to discover a fresh water source for the lake.

Further updates will be made as they become available.
