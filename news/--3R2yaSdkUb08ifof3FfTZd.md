# Holoprojectors
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/holoprojectors

A **holoprojector** is a display technology capable both of 2D image displays on various surfaces and of 3D projecting. It was invented by the Gallente megacorporation [Impetus](hph5RyllJ61G3aO6A0m4g) in 23178 AD.

Holoprojectors may for instance be installed in paper bags to allow billboards filled with advertisements to be projected over them.

Most museums have proper 3D projectors that place an image of the item
over the actual display so that viewers can get a full look at it
without having to move too much.

The [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) ship captain and scientist [Trevor Kekkonen](2WqL1GocE2qDpqPQnb9Iv3) had one of these at his lab office
at the [CreoDron](3lCriaLYr0Nrmj9pkru5Z3) factory orbiting [Atlulle III](2Jtkm8UAtWTObh0P1SkFi2). When [Orsetta Lexmoreau's](6X2MS3haT7Ufi8eTAlpilz) team had completed the
development of one of Trevor's projects, she used some sort of remote
control to switch on Trevor's projector to display a
[blueprint](2jdWyizy6WC4rfbjC7px6T).

The blueprint was presented as a series of three-dimensional images
floating over his lab desk, moving rapidly in successive sequence from
mathematical equations to subatomic particle diagrams; from molecular
compound models to exploded-view engineering drawings of mechanical
components; and finally to the animation of those same components
converging perfectly with each other to form schematics of the finished
product. It then displayed performance and statistical information
scrolling down along each side of the image.

[Duvolle Laboratories](3QCpkge6X3XwSBJ3DLTrn0) had holograms in
meeting rooms. The screensaver was revolving pies and charts. A laser
pointer could be used to highlight certain areas of the projection.
