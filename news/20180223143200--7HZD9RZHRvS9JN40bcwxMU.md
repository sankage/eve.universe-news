4C-B7X, Outer Ring - Outer Ring Excavations (ORE) has issued a profits update to its investors, expecting unprecedented profits before the end of the first quarter of YC120.

After having already gone through a long streak of rising profits for the corporation since joining the Upwell Consortium, ORE officials have stated that this first quarter's profits will exceed even their own optimistic models, and will likely follow through to the second quarter.

When questioned, ORE representatives indicated that the profit increases are due to several high-value short-term contracts that have been closed recently, taken together with increasing returns from the ORE Technologies spin-off corporation's research and product development efforts.

Following further questions from the press, both ORE and Upwell officials dismissed the notion that these profits were due to new secret projects within the Upwell Consortium, and were unwilling to disclose any other details regarding the nature or origin of the profits.
