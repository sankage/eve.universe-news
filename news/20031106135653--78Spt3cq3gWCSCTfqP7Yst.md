The Caldari Chief Executive Panel, the highest authority within the Caldari State, has decided to look into the grave matters surrounding the Protein Delicacies manufactured and distributed by the Sukuuvestaa Corporation. The Panel will decide whether there is a cause for any further actions to be taken in the matter. The Federation has already sent stern protests to Caldari authorities through diplomatic channels within CONCORD, and spokesman for the Federation said he hoped this investigation by the Chief Executive Panel was an indication that the Caldari were taking these protests seriously and would subsequently take appropriate action against the culprits.
