 **Malkalen, Lonetrek** \- On the 5.15.113, the Ishukone-Raata Enforcement Directive held the 3rd annual memorial of the Malkalen Disaster.   
  
John Revenent, CEO of Revenent Defence Corperation and member of The Ishukone-Raata Enforcement Directive, reminded capsuleers of the disaster: "On the date of 05.15.110 YC the Gallente Mothership FNS - Wandering Saint set a collision course into the Ishukone Headquarters killing hundreds of thousands, including Ishukone's CEO Otro Gariushi. This event caused the dark unstable political landscape we see today."   
  
John opened up the event with a speech, in which he spoke of those who lost their lives: "May we respect the memories of the fallen, and we will never forget what they stood for."   
  
The second speaker, Varlerian Ti'kihli, paid his respects to Otro and spoke of the unity within New Eden at the event. "Right now, every single one of you - Amarr, Caldari, Minmatar, Gallente - are one; we are one. We gather here under one purpose... to honour and remember those who were killed on that fateful day three years ago."   
  
Schlaba Muhos, final speaker, concluded the event by summarising what the event is all about while also extending thanks to capsuleers who attended the event: "We send thanks to everyone for showing respect during the memorial regardless of political ties or beliefs, we hope that with this the cluster will learn from the mistakes of the past."
