# Nanolysins
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/nanolysins

**Nanolysins** are nano-machines designed to attack the cell membranes
of organic materials.

Operation
---------

Each individual machine has a net charge which, when exposed to
electrical current, causes them to align with each other so quickly that
they behave like flechettes, shredding anything in their path.

General usage
-------------

Although they would have to be produced by the hundreds of trillions to
create a pandemic effect, nanolysins are banned by numerous
international arms treaties and are classified as a WMD. They are
extremely expensive to produce and lethal to handle unprotected.
