Ezzara - The Imperial Navy has halted its pursuit of the Minmatar Elders at the Vard stargate in the Ezzara system, heeding the warning broadcast on the NEOCOM just moments ago by CONCORD. Scope News has also learned that all stargates leading into Yulai have been reopened, and confirmed that CONCORD Bureau Station appears to have been destroyed. 

Court Chamberlain Dochuta Karsoth was last seen shortly after the Elders' invasion of the Ammatar Mandate. The Ministry of Internal Order is reportedly "exhausting every measure" to locate him.
