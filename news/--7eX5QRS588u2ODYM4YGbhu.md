# Reania
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/reania

**Reania** is a crew member on board the same ship as
[Lazar](63JYAW179cJVl3tzBiGpCO). She had long, reddish hair and thick lips
when the two met, although by now her look may be rather different.

When she met Lazar, she had been there quite a bit longer than he had.
She considered their [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) kooky but
well-intentioned and agreed with Lazar the lack of mirrors on the ship
is odd.

Lazar developed romantic interest in her and the two started a
friendship. When Lazar began to grow ill, she cared for him - during
which Lazar questioned her about the new faces on
[Jatek](3t5pFetPlx67RxvKo8AqfN) and [Kralen](6nV0v83P5bLeXg8irJ40kV), but was
reassured when she said nothing is wrong with them. After Lazar met with
the capsuleer, she additionally assured Lazar of his sanity, then
subsequently slept with him, and the two began a romantic relationship.

Reania took a short break from ship work, only to return some time later
with the same face as everyone else on the ship, a face she apparently
shares with Lazar.
