# Hanging Long-Limb
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/hanging-long-limb

The **hanging long-limb** is an animal that comes from a methane-covered [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) planet. The planet's ecosystem has not changed in thousands of years and remains mostly free of human intervention. While the long limb does have some predators, it is known to be skilled at avoiding them. It is not, however, a very intelligent animal, though it does have some problem solving abilities. It is capable of quick movement but does not do so unless attempting to capture food or evade a predator.
