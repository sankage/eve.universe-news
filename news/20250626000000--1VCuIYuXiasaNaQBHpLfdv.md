### Upwell Consortium Suffers Cyberattack

The Upwell Consortium has reported compromises to the security of Equinox infrastructure following an extensive cyberattack on Tuesday. 

According to an official statement issued by the Consortium, a self-replicating worm virus was uploaded into the remote network that connects their Equinox suite. Since infiltrating the system, the virus has spread rapidly, infecting 100% of Skyhooks and Metenox drills. 

The virus targets the positioning systems of infected structures and shares the location of Metenox drills and Skyhooks that are vulnerable to attack. The virus makes use of an evolutionary algorithm that allows it to adapt to changing security protocols. This advanced adaptability of the virus has prevented Upwell from removing it or reversing its effects.

Pirate groups have been quick to respond to this new information. New Guristas and Angels recruitment efforts have been established in the Fulcrum, Zarzakh. This has lead to speculation that the Deathless Circle was aware of the cyberattack prior to its commencement. The DED, which has been working with Upwell to identify the perpetrators of the attack, would neither confirm nor deny these rumors. “The investigation is ongoing,” according to an official statement, “and all possibilities are being considered. We have no doubt that we will be able to identify the source of this attack and bring them to justice.” Upwell has denied rumors that they are also contracting Mordu’s Legion forces to extend the investigations beyond the legal limits that constrain the DED.

### Drifter Wormhole Occupiers Clash Over Mounting Controversies.

Research into the mysterious structures inside the captured Drifter wormhole systems continues as the controversial proposals of the Drifter Summit divide the leadership of the occupying factions. The Caldari and Amarr have led calls for a closed research policy within the occupying factions, while the Minmatar Republic and EDENCOM leadership have been hesitant to reject the Summit's recommendation for a more open research policy.

The Triglavians Collective has not been invited to join in the debate, but is believed to prefer a policy of “proving”, in which the information can only be shared with those who are found to be worthy. 

Despite these divisions, each faction has continued to invest greater individual efforts into Drifter research. Scientific delegations have been recorded visiting from the Minmatar, Caldari, and Amarr. EDENCOM, which does not have an established research wing, has begun recruiting for an expansive Research and Development program. EDENCOM has also begun talks with Upwell, the designers of EDENCOM’s vessels, related to the development of a new research department. These talks were, however, waylaid due to the recent cyberattack on Consortium infrastructure.
