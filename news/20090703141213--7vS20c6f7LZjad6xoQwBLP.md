 **OE-4HB, Tenal** \- RAZOR Alliance was robbed last week of over 200 billion ISK in cash and war materi el. The perpetrator, Drago Musevenii, seized the corporation's dreadnought fleet and over a hundred of the "deathstar" control towers used in RAZOR's campaign against KenZoku in the South.  
  
The theft took place on 23.06.111. RAZOR were moving ships and towers back to their home space after their successful campaign in Querious. For 12 mere hours, the large control towers used in the campaign rested in low-security space, accessible to Cutting Edge Incorporated's [CEI] logisticians.  
  
Drago Musevenii had been a member of Cutting Edge Incorporated for almost a year. He was an Executive Officer (XO), which is one rank below a director in the corporation. He had access to certain hangars with close to 100 billion ISK's value in ships and modules and to some sections of CEI's wallet, though only a few hundred million ISK were within his reach.  
  
Normally, all these goods would be stored in a RAZOR-owned outpost. Stolen items would be difficult to get safely out of the system and have a much-reduced value within it, as buyers would be limited. On the night in question, however, CEI's assets and roughly 130 of RAZOR's large control towers, their fuel and fittings were housed in low-security space, where Drago could evacuate the goods with comparative ease.  
  
"All I had to do was [empty] the corp hangar [into] my own, and then move the items across empire to sell at my leisure... I knew they would not be there long, so I acted," Drago explained.  
  
Fred0, the CEO of CEI, was far from devastated by the loss of assets, noting that each director holds close to the total value of the heist in each of their wallets. He was quite clear on what the greatest loss was, however.  
  
"The biggest blow for us is probably that we... [lost a] senior XO who was an awesome contributor to both the corp and alliance; that's what is gonna hurt. Drago honestly put in countless hours working his [bottom] off for CEI/RZR and that's what's gonna be hardest to replace."  
  
He later added "[It's a shame] to have work wasted but the only thing you can do in today's [New Eden] is look forward and put in double."

### Guiding Hand Social Club Claims Responsibility

The Guiding Hand Social Club [GH-SC], a notorious gang of thieves and saboteurs with several high-profile heists under its belt, [claimed responsibility for the theft](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D1106102) in a press release on the 25th. Istvaan Shogaatsu (the Guiding Hand Social Club's joint founder/CEO, along with Tyrrax Thorrk) stated that the RAZOR heist brought the organization of operatives and infiltrators to its one-trillionth ISK in stolen assets. Perpetrator Drago Musevenii now adamantly denies their involvement, however and accounts differ dramatically as to _why_ the robbery took place.  
  
Drago Musevenii had publically joined the GH-SC at the rank of "Operative" when he was expelled from CEI but he now claims his first contact with the organization was _after_ the theft occurred.  
  
"[Tyrrax] thought it would be good publicity if everyone thought GH-SC had infiltrated RAZOR and I was eager for the public to believe it had been a planned infiltration and heist, rather than me betraying the trust of my friends for my own personal gain."  
  
Drago went on to explain that he now deeply regretted joining the Guiding Hand Social Club, because of the knock-on effects it had on his friends still in RAZOR.  
  
"Joining GH-SC affected the friends I had in CEI more than I thought. They were brought under suspicion of also being 'GH-SC operatives.' They had their roles stripped and people started to mistrust them."  
  
CEI CEO Fred0 doesn't rule out the possibility of GH-SC involvement, but is certain that "Drago became a GH-SC operative when he got tired of CEI. This was not planned by GH-SC since he joined."  
  
Tyrrax Thorrk, Istvaan Shogaatsu's partner-in-crime in the Guiding Hand Social Club, tells a radically-different story to Drago's.  
  
"Several months ago (November I think) we acquired an operative within Cutting Edge Incorporated... He was a friend of one of our members and had landed himself in a spot of trouble we could smooth out for him."  
  
Tyrrax claims she instructed her new operative to "nestle deeper, take on additional responsibilities, help with logistics; that kind of thing."  
  
"We've found the best way to take a corporation for everything is for our agent to be its finest member. The more work you do, and the more people look to you for help and advise - the more access and trust you get."  
  
Guiding Hand Social Club deny that they were hired to rob RAZOR. Instead, they say they were proving a point. Joss Sparq and Shigsy (pilots apparently unconnected to RAZOR) had previously and separately [called GH-SC "irrelevant"](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D1095084%26page%3D2%2333). Tyrrax claims the theft was merely a demonstration of the corporation's continued relevance and their ability to strike anyone. "We're everywhere, biding our time," she explained.   
  
Was Drago Musevenii an independent agent swept into the Guiding Hand's clutches as part of a publicity stunt? Or is this a double-bluff from Tyrrax Thorrk, laying out the facts while Drago's contradictory claims create a cover for other maneuvers. Only these two people know the real story, but little that involves the Guiding Hand Social Club is ever straightforward.
