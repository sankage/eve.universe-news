The SCC-run markets in stations across the cluster have come to a grinding halt following the destruction of CONCORD Headquarters. Traders are already reporting losses in the billions as transactions made moments before core systems went offline were left unprocessed.

"This is outrageous," said Dukani Khuram. "I just put a 100 million ISK buy order out. The deposit was processed and then…[censored] nothing! I have no receipt of order. If this doesn’t get sorted out my business is ruined." Khuram is just one of many traders who have been hit by the sudden outage, with losses from today’s events already estimated to be in the trillions.
