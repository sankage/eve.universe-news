A news report posted recently by Iece Quaan concerning industrial and economic developments, sparked heated debates amongst VIP's who were invited to the Concord News Services Gala, which was supposed to herald the start of Concord's allready controversial interstellar correspondents program.   
While festivities were somewhat dampened following the expulsion from the party of several overtly argumentative VIP's, Concord continues to maintain that the program is destined to success.
