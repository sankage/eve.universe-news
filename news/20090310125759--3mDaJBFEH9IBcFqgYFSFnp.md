SEYLLIN - Evacuation of the suffering population of Seyllin  
I is likely to be the biggest humanitarian effort in  
recent years. The assembled host of Federation,  
Serpentis, CONCORD, ORE and independent vessels - an  
unlikely sight under normal circumstances - is doing its  
best to rescue as many as 500 million people from the  
surface of the radiation blast-stricken planet.   
  
Inkori Nadoux, a Federation Navy sergeant who spent the  
last two and a half hours on Seyllin I, agreed to speak to  
The Scope news team.   
  
"We were dispatched to Seyllin as soon as the distress  
calls started pouring in, and my team got deployed to a  
residential spaceport in Southern Cross. Our task was to  
assist the evacuation of a residential quarter that was  
reportedly hit worse than the others."  
  
"I've seen my share of fighting, but I have never  
witnessed such nightmare. It is hell down there. But I have  
this to say - I have also never witnessed so many different  
people working together. I have seen a Serpentis MTAC squad  
wading through pools of molten metal to rescue a bunch of  
kids; I have seen people throwing themselves into the fire  
to save complete strangers."  
  
After two hours in Southern Cross, Sergeant Nadoux's team  
was pulled back into orbit, suffering severe radiation  
burns despite heavy protection. They had been confined to  
the healthcare ward onboard CONCORD battleship Redoubt, but  
they are not willing to rest.  
  
"After we get our rad treatment, we are going back in."
