# Luxury Yacht
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/luxury-yacht

**Luxury yachts** are a type of exceedingly expensive, privately-owned,
pleasure crafts are large enough to require professional crews. The term
originally was used to describe planetary ocean-going crafts similar in
function to today's space-faring ones, it is today generally used to
refer to the latter.

Historical Background
---------------------

With the massive accumulation of wealth brought on by the addition of
spaced-based industries and economies, products and services geared
towards the very rich have also seen vast growth, particularly within
the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) and the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK).

Private space-faring vessels were once reserved for the very elite,
leaders, and those at the height of power. In time, these grew to be
luxuriously appointed, as these men and women often spent an inordinate
amount of time traveling. Within a few decades, the market in these
types of vessels grew beyond this niche to include CEOs,
[Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) families, and anyone rich enough to afford
them, and in some cases, those that couldn't.

Uses
----

While yachts of this type are generally owned privately and are reserved
for their owner's exclusive use, many of these are available for
part-time charter, particularly within the Gallente Federation. A
growing number are purchased for use only as charter vehicles. These are
normally used for pleasure cruises, sight-seeing tours, and private
functions.

Major Manufacturers
-------------------

One of the best known vessels of this type, the Opux, is also the most
rare, and by [YC 112](year-yc112) the company had claimed it
sold six, though only four have ever been registered. Despite the small
number in existence, the Opux has been popularized by the Gallente media
to the point that it has become a standard symbol of wealth within the
Federation. Manufactured by a private firm, the Opux is widely
acknowledged to be the apex of luxury yacht design by those in the
industry.

[Viziam](6bgpJT6TtVO3nikHRQKLz0) is probably the best known luxury yacht
manufacturer in the Amarr Empire, and are favored by royalty and holder
families, such as the [Ardishapur Family](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO).
