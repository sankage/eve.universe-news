# Unconfirmed reports of major Alliance leakage
Published on 2005-04-13T18:17:51 at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/unconfirmed-reports-of-major-alliance-leakage

Reports have been filtering in that the known terrorist organisation "United against Decadence and Impurity" (UDI), has obtained some highly sensitive documents, which if true, means that the Ushra’Kahn alliance has suffered a major security leak.   
  
The documents are rumoured to contain not only the identities of a large portion of the members of the Ushra’Kahn, but their most commonly used ships, the setups and what stations their agents inhabit. It goes on to name all of the corporations in the alliance, along with their supporting non-alliance corporations and what systems they tend to inhabit.   
  
It is unclear immediately what effect this news will have on the internal structure of the Ushra’Kahn, or how the information even managed to fall into the hands of a terrorist organisation as prominent as the UDI. Theories range from defecting Ushra’Kahn members to a chance salvage from a ship wreck in decaying orbit.   
  
Due to the secretive nature of the UDI, we have been unable to get in contact with any of their members for comments, but these reports, if true could spell disaster for the growing alliance. There is no telling what uses the UDI could put that information to.
