# Ana Utulf
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/ana-utulf

Ana Utulf (born YC17) is the former governor of the [Ammatar Mandate](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz). A [Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2)
by birth, Utulf was the first [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) to rise to
the position of governor of the Mandate, the post having previously been
occupied solely by [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo). Utulf attained
cluster-wide notoriety for encouraging Nefantar to defect to the
Minmatar Republic during the Elder Invasion in
YC110.

Early Life
----------

Ana Utulf was born to the prestigious Utulf family. They were one of the
first Nefantar clans to begin collaborating with the Amarr following the
Day of Darkness and retained favored status among their Amarr overlords
for centuries later. Their status meant they were one of the largest
slave owning families in the Mandate. Ana, who was surrounded by
family-owned slaves as a child, enjoyed a privileged upbringing and
attended the finest Amarr schools. She received a full scholarship to
the Ammatar Consular University.

As a member of the Utulf family, Ana was destined for a life of
leadership. In YC43, she was appointed the overseer of a small
plantation in Tanoo. Under her tenure, Tanoo was recognized as being
among the most efficient plantations in the Mandate, regularly
outproducing larger competitors. Slave revolts and deaths, commonplace
under her predecessors, were eradicated thanks to a strict system of
punishment and rewards. Her efforts received several commendations from
the local Theology Council
representatives, who noted slaves under Ana's preview showed impressive
religious growth.

By YC56, Ana was the slave overseer of the entire Tanoo system, having
received the full blessing of both Ammatar and Amarr leaders. Though
individual plantations and mines never reached the efficiency of her
first assignment, production and slave contentment was up across the
board. It was during this time that some Amarr began to believe she was
too soft on slaves, but her results spoke for themselves.

Entry into politics
-------------------

Given the strength of the slave industries under Utulf's command, it was
no surprise when she entered into Mandate politics. In YC67, Utulf
successfully petitioned the Ammatar Consulate for the position of
governor of Chidah. Though some considered the appointment a step down
from her position as Tanoo's slave overseer, Utulf became renowned for
the energy and passion she brought to the position. Within a year, she
initiated reforms to the system's extensive mining operations, aimed
primarily at increasing profitability by reducing deaths and injuries.
In YC74, Utulf negotiated for the opening of a
[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) Assembly Plant in the system. Though the
plant would not open until after Utulf had left the office, it was
widely considered a coup for the Ammatar.

Utulf was promoted to the position of governor of Anares constellation
in YC76, following the untimely death of the former governor. She only
held the position for a short time before taking a position as head of
the Ammatar Consulate's Trade and
Commerce division. During her tenure there, Utulf encouraged the entire
Mandate to adopt more modern slave holding practices, mimicking those
used among more liberal [Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) in the Empire.
This move proved unpopular with Ammatar slave owners, as the practices
were more costly, but won her wide acclaim from the liberal-leaning
[Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV) government.

She increased trade with the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy),
granting several lucrative mining licenses to Caldari corporations and
reducing tariffs on Caldari imports. At the same time, she opened
limited trade with the Minmatar Republic during a brief cease-fire
between the two long-time enemies in YC84. Though the trade agreement
ultimately fell through when hostilities reignited, Utulf gained the
respect of many Minmatar corporate heads. More successfully, she pushed
for several trade treaties with the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK). Though never as profitable
as either side hoped, the pipeline remains as a source of Gallente goods
entering the Amarr Empire.

Rise to Consulate High Commissioner
-----------------------------------

By YC91, the Ammatar Mandate was flourishing financially under Utulf's
direction, having dramatically increased trade with the Caldari,
solidified the economic importance of the region for the Empire, and
improved the standard of living for free Ammatar across the Mandate.
Despite her success, it still surprised many when Governor Ibrar Ondagoi
named her the High Commissioner of the Ammatar Consulate, the highest
position an Ammatar could attain in the Mandate at the time.

As High Commissioner, Utulf publicly proclaimed the goal of greater
integration with the Amarr Empire, though her policies seemed to push
the two apart. She encouraged a build up of the Ammatar Fleet, an act that within five years resulted
in a significant increase in the percentage of Ammatar in leadership
positions. She increased trade with the Caldari and Gallente and worked
for a lasting peace with the Minmatar Republic.

In YC109, Utulf initiated formal peace talked
with the Minmatar Republic, a move that was viewed with mixed emotions
from both Empire and Mandate citizens. Though Governor Ondagoi claimed
the Empire was fully aware of the planned talks, analysts widely
believed the Empire had been left in the dark by Utulf. Although the
peace talks were marred by terrorist bombings from the [Bloody Hands of Matar](1zKTY7AnnG3F5pzlKws52w), Utulf remained hopeful an
accord could be reached.

Rise to Ammatar Governor and subsequent defection
-------------------------------------------------

Late in YC109, Governor Ondagoi stepped down from his post as Ammatar
Governor, citing failing health. In a stunning move, Utulf was named his
successor, becoming the first Ammatar Governor of Ammatar birth.
Chamberlain [Karsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL), acting leader of the Amarr
Empire, affirmed the appointment without fanfare. Utulf retained her
position as High Commissioner of the Ammatar Consulate following her
appointment, causing some opponents to claim she was attempting to
gather power.

When the existence of [Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) survivors was
discovered in the Mandate in YC110, Utulf moved slowly in getting the
Consulate involved. Some observers believed she deliberately slowed the
Amarr investigations of the claims, though publicly she offered the
Consulate's full support.

In June of YC110, the Elder Fleet invaded the Ammatar Mandate. Utulf
shocked the cluster once again by usurping all Mandate communications
channels and urging Ammatar to defect to the Republic. Utulf herself
connected with Elder Fleet drop ships and escaped from the Mandate under
heavy escort.

Current situation
-----------------

Utulf successfully managed to escape to the Minmatar Republic following
the Elder Invasion. Though there was some momentum for Utulf to take a
position as the head of the revived Nefantar Tribe, she never made any
motions toward seeking the appointment. Shortly after, Ana Utulf quietly
disappeared from the political radar in the Republic, apparently
retiring to a life of solitude. She remains a wanted criminal in both
the Ammatar Mandate and Amarr Empire, though no public attempts have
been made to capture her.
