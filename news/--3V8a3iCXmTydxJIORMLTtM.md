# Ethnic Gallente
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/ethnic-gallente

The **ethnic Gallente** are one of the primary races of the
[Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK). They are the descendants of
both the original ethnicities of [Gallente Prime](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a)
and the various other bloodlines that
they have mingled with over the past several centuries. As founding
hosts of the only true democracy of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk),
they have created an ethnically
diverse, culturally rich and progressive society that encourages
enterprise and initiative in its citizens, valuing freedom and
individual liberty above all else. Even though estimates put the
ethnic Gallente numbering at slightly over a third of the Federation's
total population (just about making them the largest group), their
cultures and traditions nonetheless dominate large parts of the union.
They are the driving force within the Federation as far as interstellar
society is concerned, having directly and indirectly influenced other
empires to varying degrees.

Appearance
----------

The ethnic Gallente bear very little resemblance to their historical
predecessors who came before the days of modern spaceflight. They are a
mixed race, their appearance varying moreso than any other major
bloodline in New Eden, having intermingled with the vast amount of
immigrants that flock to the Federation, diluting their racial
makeup further (even someone who identifies as an ethnic Gallente may
actually have a [True Amarr](2DkiJVfiL1RYP5y7AJGSNN) parent).

Even the self-titled original descendants (those who are able to trace
the genetic contributions of both of their parents to the Luminaire
homeworld) among the ethnic Gallente are still a mixed race. Unlike the
[Deteis](7vixEvaBXQYC2ywT3fyAwd) and [Civire](1lEM3yHeoK1HEpa1FrLwH5), True Amarr
and [Khanid](1IRIdXfOZrfl5BuFuabOh6), and the [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)
races, the different ethnicities of Gallente Prime did not retain their
racial distinctiveness into the spacefaring era. This extreme genetic
diversity allowed the ethnic Gallente to not be limited by a world's
climate or ecology in colonization, permitting them to expand relatively
rapidly compared to other races. A strong immune system and resistance
to disease also helped this.

However, there has been a distinct appearance of the ethnic Gallente
that has become somewhat identifiable amongst the spacefaring
populations of New Eden. Both male and female ethnic Gallente both trend
toward innocuous appearances, relatively average height, and sleek
builds. Outliers among them can be as pale as some [Deteis](7vixEvaBXQYC2ywT3fyAwd), dark as some
[Brutor](5xBrtZyeYfTxWkZTO1o5zg), short as some
[Vherokior](6VDPzsKX9TVbVtXEwjj0RB), curvaceous as some
[Ni-Kunni](5zoewV2VJJnYgvWj0Khn1K), waifish as some
[Sebiestor](1fNour0sFTIcCFRVQM2pro), or as broad-shouldered as some
[Civire](1lEM3yHeoK1HEpa1FrLwH5).

Sociopolitical anthropologists have explored how the "harmoniously
blended" appearance of the ethnic Gallente has contributed to their
trading and diplomatic ability with other races, and promoted their
prevalence in New Eden's sex industry. Not possessing any extreme traits
such as potentially intimidating height or easily ridiculed
diminutiveness has made them appear less threatening and more amiable to
other races, without coming across as pushovers.

History
-------

The [history of the ethnic Gallente](K3yMi4r4UmMMOqIip9Vj3) is split into five
distinct epochs, each covering at least one of the standard historical
ages used in other documents. The Age of the Ancients is characterized
by having poor historical records and no cohesive societal or
technological developments, running up to the Iron Age at most. The Age
of Rouvenor is named after the king of the Garoun Empire, a large
multinational kingdom that had its height during the Seafaring Age, and
would ultimately have an unrivalled influence on the planet's future.
The Age of Industrialization is self-explanatory, while the Age of
Globalization started during the ethnic Gallente's Information Age. The
current epoch, the Age of Federation, began during Luminaire's Space
Age, and continues to this day.

The ethnic Gallente's history is unique in the sense it is not
characterized by a single dominant ethnic group or nation assimilating
all its rivals by direct or indirect means. Instead, the world went
under a relatively peaceful process called globalization, where
individual races (each represented by one or more nation-states) would
trade with one another on diplomatic and non-violent terms. This process
would begin as early as the Seafaring Age, but it wasn't until the
creation of a global telecommunications network in the Information Age
that nurtured a planetary identity, linking individuals with
individuals, not states with states. The term 'Gallente' only emerged
after encountering the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) for the first time,
where both races would have identified themselves as simply human
otherwise.

Since records began in the [Age of Rouvenor](K3yMi4r4UmMMOqIip9Vj3#age-of-rouvenor), the history of the ethnic
Gallente covers over one and a half thousand years.

Culture
-------

The [culture of the ethnic Gallente](3KPzZojLPGemwl6JBzGZBr) is noted for its
heavy focus on individual self-expression. The arts cover a wide array
of practices that tend to have strong and often unclear philosophical
undertones, while fashion and music is very much oriented to individual
happiness rather than enforcing a social order.

A unique tenet of ethnic Gallente culture is that they do not see their
own cultures as an exclusive ethnic or national product, because they do
not generally divide humanity into races and bloodlines as other
cultures do. While this has resulted in certain Gallente having a habit
of lifting elements of other cultures for their own, the habit of seeing
culture as a universal human product means that the ethnic Gallente have
been more than happy to export their practices to other empires for them
to make use of. Typically, practices such as musical composition or
tailoring techniques would be exported to other empires, and
subsequently left for that culture to adapt according to their own
particular aesthetic or style. For example, very few would go out of
their way to point out that a Caldari businessperson is actually wearing
an outfit that has Gallente origins.

Instead, the freeflow and exchange of culture across the stars is seen
by the ethnic Gallente as something that promotes interstellar and
cross-cultural harmony. On a few occassions, the ethnic Gallente's
failure to realize that this ideology must be shared by both parties for
it to be successful has had the consequence of these good intentions
sparking off tensions or, in the worst case, war. For the most part, the
ethnic Gallente using culture as a vehicle of peace has proven very
attractive to down-on-their-luck members of other races, and it is for
this reason that they have shaped the Federation to be an entity that
unites worlds via non-violent means.

Society
-------

Attempting to categorize the [society of the ethnic Gallente](6I0qDxzqZcDRdNH3CgppIn)
is often considered
a crime by many, being quick to accurately point out that there is no
single ethnic Gallente society. Even though [FTL communications](7Eqc0yOgUoUswOop0Q2uMQ)
and GalNet have spawned
so-called 'readily identifiable' traits that are perceived as mainstream
Federation society (mostly stereotypes by outsiders), the truth of the
matter is that the only unifying element of the ethnic Gallente is
individualism. What individualism means varies from person to person,
resulting in patterns and practices that cannot be so strictly defined
as they are with other cultures in New Eden. Many ethnic Gallente
continue to disagree as to whether or not the definition of
individualism is a non-exhaustive list, and these same individuals are
locked in a never-ending debate as to who and what exactly constitutes a
Gallente.

Nonetheless, as much as traditionalists would disagree, there are still
a few habits of the ethnic Gallente societies that are persistent. The
most notable element is that the ethnic Gallente, despite the name,
generally do not care for an individual's ethnic or social background.
Being a race of multiple ethnicities themselves, these ethnic Gallente
care more for individual character than anything else. Of course, what
is considered a virtue of personal character varies from place to place.
Those who can take care of themselves without any outside help might be
welcome in [Solitude](mQjw4DzdzeHF8rNpzaZKr), while those more interested
in the social high culture may prefer [Caille](73TXaac6RTgSJaqJHkTxCz).

The pursuit of the arts and sciences is considered a common element
across many ethnic Gallente societies. Indeed, travelling the
Federation, one can see how each community has implemented various
technologies for the purposes of social harmony and ease-of-living. In
places with high levels of automation (and thus relatively lower working
weeks), leisure activities are commonplace. Religions are a common
pursuit too, as the lack of any societal instillment of purpose has led
to many ethnic Gallente pursuing the meaning of life on their own.

The outward nature of the ethnic Gallente (as well as the very loose and
open definition of the term) means that their practices often apply to
non-ethnic Gallente, even those who may identify as [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn), [Mannar](4BaMCkOwYaPpd4ZMtEfEY), or
[Jin-Mei](6SFvK45QIlCCCoNODY3gUB). This even applies to cultural and societal tenets that have
been explicitly identified as having origins within Luminaire.
