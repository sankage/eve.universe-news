Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/dam-imud

The **Dam-Imud** was an Apocalypse-class [capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ)-piloted battleship destroyed with the loss of 6,314 crew casualties at an unknown location and time. An [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) capsuleer was the pilot of the Dam-Imud. He appeared of indeterminate age, with soft, pale skin with unusual golden lines running under its surface. This individual recruited at least one crewman to his ship in person and may have carried out other business deals while outside his capsule.
