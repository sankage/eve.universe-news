Amarr - A team of archaeologists, originally thought lost after the system where their dig was located became a battleground between the Empire and the Republic, have returned relatively unscathed to Amarr today after experiencing what they referred to as "a little trouble."

Appearing healthy and content at a press conference in Dam-Torsad yesterday, the archaeologists announced that they had retrieved several artifacts which could hold "some significance." They refused to go into detail, however, until such time as their research will be complete.

The Ardishapur Family, which had sponsored the dig, passed on its relief at the team's deliverance and stated that it was eager to hear the results of its findings.
