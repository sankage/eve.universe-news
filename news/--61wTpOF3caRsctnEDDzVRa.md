# Sispur
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/sispur

**Sispur** is a [Nefantar](1lfEcB4SdrV3EJIrmYWOK2) who recently returned to
the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) following the Elder War on
the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo).

At one point he visited a bar where he met [Annes](7Bqq6D5C1V2ysqEID8wOG8) and
[Triat](331ej8qexWhiEiFsLNZJuF). Sispur reflected with them on the current
state of the Republic, bemoaning his position as a Nefantar. He sees
himself as a mirror onto which others reflect their views of the
Republic; either he is a hero for helping save the
[Starkmanir](1L5eoorvzFUylWwag0xeQw) or he is a
[traitor](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) to the Minmatar. Despite his misgivings,
he has realized that the Republic is the only place he could ever truly
live.
