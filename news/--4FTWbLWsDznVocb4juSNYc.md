# Perime Veaulore
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/perime-veaulore

**Perime Veaulore**, known also as Eamom Delviour, is the son of
[Yosif](1vyqZVXMmvgH8Q6h4tqdsz) and Verine Veaulore. After his
mother's death, Perime approached his father about founding Lost Stars,
Inc, a recovery company for the interstellar deceased, so that what
happened to their mother's corpse would not happen to others.

Some time after founding the company, Perime developed psychological
problems. He committed assault, engaged in unlawful harvesting of
biomass, and apparently even performed necrophilia. His father helped
him escape under an assumed name and he began serving on one of Lost
Stars, Inc's biomass recovery ships. There, he was able to save the
corpses of several women, and used them for his own perversities.
Eventually, he was exposed and arrested by [Quafe](7AX2o1TfJkN853SBNTsEmD)
security, though in hopes of avoiding negative publicity, they did not
present the crimes to the government . He was tied to the
[Quafe+](7LIn9llI0ZBSXDQ1VxZr2g) fiasco along with his father.
