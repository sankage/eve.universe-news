**Tiny** is a [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) smuggler transporting
[Tonic 12](4TB3D35LnlUOs8zkY3DfXd) for his associate,
[Karlo](79GMsvCGNnWQwkAKZ5gMFM). He had previously been pod-killed by [Adira Habi](1Sr23xcI65EvolMmBeZRRt), and encounters the other pilot again on
the Sharuveil [gate](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) in Decon. Despite the urgency
of his mission, Tiny follows Adira as he warps away to planet IV.
