Early reports even suggest that some capsuleers may have even fired upon each other rather than deal with the Sansha forces in the system.   
  
Early reports also suggest that the Sansha forces were able to bypass jamming systems by entering through wormholes.   
  
The Interstellar Correspondents will be following up with a full detailed report shortly.
