EVE_NT is also hosting a viewer party at Antenna in Nottingham, United Kingdom. If you're in the area, you should grab a ticket and join them for all the fun and action from the tournament. [More details can be found here](https://eve-nt.yapsody.com/event/index/110006?ref=ebtn).

The final two weekends will be [broadcast by CCP](https://www.twitch.tv/ccp) from our studio here in Reykjavik Iceland, where we'll be covering every match with the help of a team of [expert player commentators](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/eve-online-news/at-xv-feeder-results/). Make sure you're there for every match as this is when the best teams will be bringing everything they have to the table to win.

##  Show your colors

This year we are adding some new ways for you to show your support for the Alliance Tournament. First up is a new IGC themed background for your character portrait. This is available for free to every pilot in New Eden right now, so show your support by grabbing it today.

Additionally, we will be offering IGC themed SKINs for the entire line of Serpentis ships in the New Eden Store. We'll be rolling out a different group each week starting July 25, starting with the Violator and Daredevil SKINs.

##  Billboard Blitz

If you have skills with making videos, you'll be pleased to know we have a contest just for you. The Independent Gaming Commission is commissioning the creation of advertisements to be played on billboards across New Eden to promote the upcoming tournament, and is now accepting submissions from Capsuleers. They will be selecting four videos to be played on billboards, and as a reward are offering 1000 PLEX and IGC SKINs. Details are as follows:

  * [Videos must follow all normal rules for billboard submissions](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/eve-online-news/billboard-submissions-are-now-open/). Note that the Fancy UI used for the tournament broadcast is permitted in videos if you wish to use footage from tournament matches.
  * Videos must promote the Alliance Tournament. Part of the judgement of videos will be on how well they promote the tournament
  * Videos may also contain promotion of a team participating in Alliance Tournament XV
  * Videos may not include promotion of player entities not involved in Alliance Tournament XV
  * Videos must be submitted to [logibro@ccpgames.com](mailto:logibro@ccpgames.com) before 23:59UTC, 2017-07-30
