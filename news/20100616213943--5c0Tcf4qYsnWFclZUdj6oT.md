 **6NJ8-V, Venal** \- Three titans - an Erebus, an Avatar and a Ragnarok - flying for Northern Coalition alliances RAZOR Alliance and Morsus Mihi have been confirmed downed in the system of 6NJ8-V where intense fighting is taking place between RAZOR and White Noise.   
  
Participants in the battle have reported over 1,000 pilots in the system where White Noise, Red Alliance and their allies allegedly had set a trap for the Northern Coalition supercapital forces. There are rumours of more titans dead along with multiple supercarriers, but this cannot yet be verified.
