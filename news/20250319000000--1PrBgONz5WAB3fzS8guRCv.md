### Race Continues as Harmonics Research Published

Significant changes in research and development at Crisis sites across the cluster after the first week of the newly dubbed “Race for the Hives”. Thousands of capsuleers have joined the competing factions in their efforts to develop means to occupy the Drifter Wormholes. Only the top five factions will be able to put their new technology into effect and occupy one of the five Drifter Wormhole systems.

Research has also finally been completed on the Warden Connection Harmonics recovered by capsuleers from Tabbetzur. A heavily redacted research paper published by the Caldari State’s School of Applied Knowledge has shown that harmonic sequences can be constructed in order to open up a backdoor to the Warden in Zarzakh. This backdoor is based on accessing a network of hyperspace connections that are routed through the Warden itself. 

It is theorized that this network is connected to the hyperspace telemetry used to predict Drifter activities, and their wormhole systems. Because of this, access to the Harmonics provides a significant advantage in the research and development of methods for Drifter Wormhole occupancy.

This graph, and the information below, show each participating faction's share of the total contributions received up to this point:

- Triglavian - 29.1% (down 17.2%)
- Caldari - 14.8% (up 8.2%)
- Minmatar - 14.3 (up 8.7%)
- EDENCOM - 9.6% (up 5.0%)
- Angels - 9.5% (up 0.8%)
- Amarr - 7.2% (down 6.8%)
- Gallente - 5.1% (down 3.1%)
- SOCT - 3.6% (up 2.8%)
- Upwell - 3.5% (up 0.8%)
- EverMore	- 3.4% (up 0.4%)

### Impact of Harmonics

Information was leaked today by an anonymous source including an analysis of what the research progress would have been without the advantages gained from access to Warden Connection Harmonics. If this information is correct, it tells an interesting story about how the Harmonics have impacted the current situation.

The majority of Harmonics gathered by capsuleers were handed over to the Minmatar Republic. It was the Republic Fleet that carried out Operation Harmony Breach in Tabbetzur, the two military strikes that revealed the Harmonics to New Eden. The second-highest number of Harmonics were given to the Triglavians (almost half as many as the Minmatar), with the Caldari receiving the third most (a little over half as many as the Triglavians). 

Despite these generous submissions, the shift towards the Minmatar slightly negatively impacted the overall positioning of these first- and second-place factions. This impact would have been notably greater were it not for the Harmonics they received from dedicated capulseers.

### Analysis

The Triglavians have seen a significant reduction in their lead. Despite that, they remain the clear front runners with almost double the share of the Caldari second position. More and more Capsuleers continue to flock to the Triglavians, with their long history of conflict with the Drifters and their powerful technology. 

The Caldari have risen to second place thanks to a growing group of dedicated capsuleers who have carried them from fifth to second place. This rise is only fitting considering their rapid response to the Drifter threat that was pushed back in New Caldari last week. The capsuleers who triumphed over the Vigilant Dreamer in New Caldari were awarded the Honor of Landfall medal by Chairman Akimaka Saraki. In an announcement by the Landfall monument on New Caldari, Saraki praised those who had fought for the Caldari’s capital system as “war heroes who understand the importance of duty.” Seventy-seven capsuleers received the medal, including one of the top Harmonics contributors, Remilia Malitia. 

Saraki went on to caution against the rising support for the Triglavians; “They stole our worlds and plunged our stars into darkness. Long ago these masked invaders abandoned their humanity to the Abyss, along with their honor. We must trust ourselves and our State in this coming fight. It is we Caldari who are the cluster's best hope for victory.”

The Angel Cartel has slid into fifth place, a slim fraction behind EDENCOM. Security forces throughout the cluster are reporting rising crime indicative of massive shifts in New Eden’s underworld as the Cartel’s operatives make ready for the new technologies they hope to gain.

EDENCOM is the only new group to enter the top five, having made a huge rise from their initial seventh position. Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir delivered a speech to the CONCORD Assembly urging them to invest in EDENCOM; “Chairman Saraki and the other leaders of the CONCORD member nations are mistaken if they think going it alone is going to win them this war. A single nation cannot stand against the Drifter threat. EDENCOM is a dedicated specialist force. It was we who held the line against the Triglavians, and we are the only ones capable of shutting down the Drifters once and for all. Once more we are ready to stand against any who would threaten our way of life, not for one nation, but for all humanity.”

The Amarr have fallen out of the top five despite a positive impact on their relative position due to Harmonics. The Royal Palace has declined to comment on the shift. While the Royal Houses still present a united front, there are rumors that critics of the Empress have blamed their declining progress on her failure to inspire the faithful. The Gallente Federation has continued to struggle as well, unable to rise from seventh place.

The SOCT has begun slowly advancing but has only climbed to eighth place. EverMore has fallen to last place despite acquiring a significant number of Harmonics. Upwell has similarly failed to inspire dedication in the capsuleers of New Eden. These two massive corporate entities attempts to compete with the major nations and the military forces of New Eden have so far failed to bear fruit. While the Consortium has declined to comment, President of EverMore Alexander Ducasse gave an interview to IMN affiliates this morning stating that “the competition is not over yet, and while we may not have the numbers of nations like the Caldari or Triglavians, I can assure you EverMore is not to be ignored.”
