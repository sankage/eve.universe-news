The Gallentean senate is set to convene next week to discuss the recent proposal by senator LeCroix to lower tariffs on consumer electronics exported to the Minmatar republic. The market in these items has recently been declining for federation businesses due largely to increasing domestic competition within the republic.   
  
The proposal has largely been met with enthusiasm by the industry, and few foresee any problems with the upcoming vote.
