PATOR - Wentach Mennar, an ex-member of parliament for the Representative Party, issued a statement today defending the decision to award grant money to the Minmatar People's Theatre for their staging of 600-year-old play 'Plantation.' 

"Grants are made on the basis of the applicant, not on the merits of the project. The MPT has been providing quality theatre here in the capital for over 15 years," said Mennar. "The fact so many people are talking about the play should be proof this troupe knows what they are doing." Equality in Action, a media watch group protesting the staging of the play, responded by saying they found nothing funny about "cashing in on racism to fill seats."
