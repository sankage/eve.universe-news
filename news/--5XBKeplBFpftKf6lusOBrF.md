**Semou** is a constellation. It was coming
under increased [Blood Raider](7obiU8rOyJkPZ3S0Faxc5W) raids in
[YC105](7fPQjSvh0UicNGNdh3nVkd). The governor, fearing a similar fate to
settlements in [the Bleak Lands](1thJ31aFnpCVAbE0rkntPP), requested
the ability to form a space fighting force, but was denied by the [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ).
