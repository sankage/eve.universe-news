A high ranking Amarr official is expected to arrive in Ammatar space later today carrying plans for an Ammatar offensive against the Minmatars. This is the first indication that the Amarrians are taking steps to respond against the increasing Minmatar incursions into their space. While the details of the plans are not known it is expected that they involve information about known Minmatar rebels, their bases and defences. In the hands of the warlike Ammatars this information might deal a heavy blow to the rebels, which they might never recover from.
