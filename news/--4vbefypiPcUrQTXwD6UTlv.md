# CD-1
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/cd-1

**CD-1** is the call sign of the [CreoDron](3lCriaLYr0Nrmj9pkru5Z3) Flagship. To most observers this ship would be a monstrosity. Horrifically warped Dominix hulls over-flowing with esoteric electronics equipment evocative of the spikes on [Sansha](6dFZYDkE3R4BRF9w21mtjP) vessels, it is nonetheless the beloved 'mothership' of CreoDron scientists, filling the dual roles of mobile research lab and as a home. It is a sign of the importance of the Vitrauze project that the choice was made to use it as a decoy to distract the [Black Eagles](6eVk3icIk4UHf5Uh799xDN), knowing it would be confiscated by the [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK).
