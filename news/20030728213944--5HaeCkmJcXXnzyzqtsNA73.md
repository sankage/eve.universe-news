Caldari police forces in the system have been accused of shooting at, and even destroying the ships of innocent spacefarers, near the Crielere jumpgates. Police officials say that this was done to ensure the safety of the new research center in the system. They claim that they are holding secret information, proving beyond doubt, an imminent, serious threat to the invaluable research center. They furthermore claim that they are in full right to deal with such situations in every way the police deems necessary. Gallente officials and several human rights agencies, have condemned the methods of the Caldari forces and demand an investigation. Concord has given out an official statement, advising all travelers to stay away from the system at the moment, while this unfortunate matter is still under investigation.
