In a statement from Admiral Baryn today, CONCORD issued an emergency travel advisory for the Jakemhih and Kashag constellations, Domain region. "A large number of unprovoked pirate attacks have been reported in those systems," Baryn said. "The identities of the attackers remains unconfirmed, but in all cases the attacks were swift, merciless, and with superior firepower." CONCORD warns that any pilots in the area may be putting themselves at risk.
