Yonis Ardishapur announced that he would be making a personal visit to the new site of the Tal-Romon Cathedral to pay his respects and also to inspect the rebuilding. As one of the preeminent private collectors of ancient artifacts in all of known space, Yonis Ardishapur's opinion could determine the success or failure of Doriam II's relocation effort in the eyes of the general public. No other details of the planned visit were available for security reasons.
