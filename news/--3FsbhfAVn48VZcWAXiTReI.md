# Wind of the West
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/wind-of-the-west

Wind-of-the-West is one of the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)
spirits.

Wind-of-the-West comes from the Great Western Sea of [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i), and he is seen as the Wind which
carries the rain to the homelands of the Caldari. The presence of
Wind-of-the-West is seen in fog and gentle rains, and in the tang of
salt air. A guardian of the waters, Winds-of-the-West was venerated
highly by sailors and all along the west coast of the Raata Empire; in
Caldari folklore, Winds-of-the-West not only taught the Caldari to sail
but the ways of trade as well, making him second only to Cold Wind in
the minds of modern Caldari.

Other divine entities include [Mountain Wind](NEtuLo38zgFK9ZA0sGYCk), [Cold Wind](16iSgSK58hOq8DIlx2oqKS),
[Heart-of-the-Forest](3zH6qMixgVJtQUgHF3KFFM), and [Storm Wind](vAU7b4dGGPGQNp6QRw6mX).
