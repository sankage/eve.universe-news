Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/rumida

**Rumida** is a planet in the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo). An ocean on Rumida was impacted by an asteroid around YC 100. Thousands of homes were destroyed and people killed as a result of powerful shockwaves which plowed through the surface along a path several kilometers wide. Several thousand people were left deaf thanks to intense sound waves. This event is similar to one prophesied in a century-old book called "[The Seven Events of the Apocalypse](1vsutxaE6RLjfDo0cJuevU)."
