**Vertan Nejowin** works for a plastic surgery corporation, that
secretly provides [face-swap](4OVv2l5wpw0mh2pvDdFKSv) procedures. His
office is richly appointed with a [holo-frame](3yafvTdLzDP8Y6rUI6QNaX) on
the wall and wooden desk on which he keeps a bowl of candy. He has no
compunction about allowing customers, including [Gilea Kiljaani](62tvm3aGxq50FiZ5Syz0Y6) and [Marlovian Joocasta](EBftucSpBxOMMWdPyyMBH), to believe the person whose
face they choose will be put to [death](5WNhh1Tm9Ucm0ni1HgOotc), though in
reality, they will live and labor face-less.
