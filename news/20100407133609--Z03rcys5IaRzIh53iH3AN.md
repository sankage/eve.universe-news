Saisio - Sukuuvestaa news networks are reporting that the company's executive board met with Ishukone CEO Mens Reppola and Hyasyoda CEO Ahtonen Osmon today at the company's Saisio headquarters. The meeting appears to have been planned in secret, or at least called on short notice, as Saisio traffic control was alerted of the two CEOs' arrival only minutes before Reppola's Chimera-class carrier jumped into the system.

Such a high level meeting between the leader of the State's Liberal political bloc and the leader of the Practical bloc's largest megacorporation has set off a torrent of rumors throughout the newsnets. The fact that all three corporations are downplaying the meeting, saying only that the summit was convened to discuss "broad-based collaborations involving a wide range of corporate ventures" has only fueled the fire.

On today's "Games of State," host Shiomiken Savalenta suggested that this was a deliberate attempt on the part of the Liberal bloc to flex its muscle. "Mens Reppola has been CEO of Ishukone for almost a year now, and the company has made great strides toward recovering from the death of [Otro] Gariushi."

Her guest, political analyst Taya Otnen, suggested that the move was more showmanship than substance. "It's important not to make more of this than it really is. Ishukone has recovered somewhat but I can't see SuVee or even the Liberal bloc openly opposing Tibus Heth right now. Reppola and Osmon are playing a dangerous game here, and I can't see [Sukuuvesta CEO] Onita wanting to rock the boat too much."
