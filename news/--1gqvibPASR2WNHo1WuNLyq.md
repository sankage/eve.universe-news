# Cleansing Pits
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/cleansing-pits

The **cleansing pits** are a part of [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) religious
doctrine, whereby, as the name indicates, sinners are taken to the pits
and "cleansed" by unknown means. The pits are notoriously harsh on their
inhabitants, and it is not unknown for a cleansing session to end in
someone's death.
