Seyllin is a solar system in the Essence region of the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK). The system is home to nine planets,
most of them unremarkable, except for [Seyllin I](rcmhOIWig0zQ49j4fNF7m),
which was heavily damaged in a stellar disaster that occurred March 10th, YC111.

History
-------

### Early History

Seyllin was originally known as TLXX-01, an
unexplored system on the fringes of Federation space. In YC 51, [Braggs Seyllin](M0L4cbMHN6vXCjNtKGIsw), a former executive at Material Acquisition, first explored the system
in an effort to make a fortune. In TLXX-01, Seyllin struck gold,
literally, when he surveyed the first planet in the system and
discovered rich deposits of valuable heavy metals.

Seyllin acquired enough venture capital through investments to establish
mining colonies on the planet. Within a few years, the investments had
paid off tens of times over. The value of the single planet eventually
brought other colonists and interests to the system, which was
eventually renamed after Seyllin a decade after his death in YC91.
By YC111, the planet accounted for a quarter of all raw ore production
in the Thoulde constellation and a
significant fraction of the Federation's supply of heavy metals and
was home to a half billion people.

### Solar Disaster

#### Radiation Burst

The system remained an important and vital part of the Federation's
economy until March 10th, YC111. The first indication of what was to
come was the sudden disruption of electronics at
"[Cassandra](47YuBR3HlvNeGKVgVupGVx)", a solar monitoring station in the
system. Shortly after, electronics on Seyllin I were disrupted and
all [communication](slULqrFiu06fLmeraX1QL) with the system was
cut off. This was the result of a massive burst of radiation
from the sun.

Roughly 10 minutes later, communications were reestablished with the
system, flooding emergency channels with distress calls. The initial
messages received were confused and jumbled, mainly being pleas for
assistance, drawing fears of a nuclear assault on the planet.

#### Relief Efforts

This initial radiation burst killed millions on the planet, wiping out
the majority of the sun-side population and bathing the entire
population in varying amounts of deadly radiation. Scientists initially
described the disaster as a "post-main sequence event" and were unable
to rule out the possibility the sun had gone supernova.
[CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) and the Federation Navy scrambled warships to provide
protection and humanitarian aid to the survivors. Shortly after,
President [Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) and CONCORD Chief of Staff Kivas
Odaka released a joint statement about the incident, announcing a plan
to evacuate the planet.

Orbital triage centers were established soon after, while
ORE and traditional Federation antagonists
[Serpentis](3igWGHqQJXyJoUnM2XgGJC) sent relief ships to assist.
However, rescue attempts were chaotic, with two drop ships
colliding, while panicked survivors transmitted distress calls to
civilian ships. Those attempting to use the planet's magrail were
trapped as the system failed.

Relief workers expressed horror and dismay over the events. One rescue
team member described the conditions as "hell", while another gave
those survivors beneath the planet's sun side little chance of
survival.

#### Stellar Ejection

After several hours of evacuation attempts, CONCORD probes investigating
the sun suddenly vanished. Soon after, CONCORD reported a large
mass of plasma accelerating toward the planet, apparently ejected from
the sun. Rescue operations were disrupted by panicked
citizens, forcing marines to open fire on the population. As a
"zero-hour" approached, all relief ships pulled out of the system and a
blockade was established, preventing further ships from entering the
system. Shortly after, communications from the system were once
again disrupted.

Several minutes later, the first contact from the system came from a
Serpentis freighter that had been trapped in the system. The freighter
reported that the first planet had been obliterated. Shortly after,
CONCORD dropped its blockade with President Foiritan releasing a
statement confirming the planet's destruction shortly after. The Scope released images shortly after, showing the
remains of the planet collapsing back under gravity, producing an image
compared to the late stages of planetary formation.

Of the half-billion residents of the planet, only a million had been
successfully evacuated. In the following months, the planet
continued its slow coalescing and reformation, as travel through the
system returned to normal levels. The destruction of Seyllin I was a
major blow to the Federation economy. The stellar ejection event led to
a change in the star's stellar classification, from Type-O to Type-A.

Sun
---

Seyllin is a blue main sequence A-class star. Prior to March 10, YC111,
it was a blue-white O-class main sequence star, but the stellar
ejection event reduced its mass significantly, causing it to drop in
size and luminosity. The star has not yet stabilized from the ejection,
with massive gravitational and electromagnetic fluctuations. It is prone
to solar flares and sudden shifts in brightness and energy output.

The star is just over 2 billion years old. As an O-class star, it was
nearing the end of its main sequence life and was expected to go
supernova in roughly a million years. Because of the unprecedented
nature of the disaster, scientists are unsure of the star's final fate.
Additionally, the change in mass has destabilized the orbits of its
planets. The changes will be minor for the near future, but on the order
of tens of thousands of years, some planets may be ejected from the
system or move closer or further from the star.

Inner Planets
-------------

### Seyllin I

Seyllin I was the primarily inhabited planet in the system. Originally a
barren planet, it was host to numerous rich deposits of valuable heavy
metals such as gold, iron, vanadium, and tungsten. The planet was
colonized following its discovery by Braggs Seyllin and quickly became a
vital part of the Federation's economy and heavy metal production.

As large tunnels were carved out underground and left empty,
subterranean terraforming attempts were made. These attempts were
successful in introducing fresh water, vegetation, artificial sunlight,
and breathable atmospheres. At its peak, four cities had been
established on the planet: Loadcore, Metal City, Southern Cross, and
Valimor. The cities were home to a half-billion people.

On March 10, YC111, the planet was struck by two consecutive disasters
originating from its sun. The first, which struck at around 8:49 [EVE Standard Time](2cJeP2eBHll85PfjQlTtHt), was a pulse of radiation that
killed thousands on the planet's sun-side surface and caused acute
radiation poisoning in those beneath the sun-side surface. The
second occurred several hours later, when a large mass of plasma ejected
from the star struck the planet. The collision destroyed the planet,
killing the population that had not been evacuated.

Following the planet's destruction, its remnants remained
gravitationally bound and slowly began to collapse back into a planet.
Once this process is complete, the planet's structure could be
drastically changed, but should still contain the majority of its metal
deposits. However, this process is expected to take thousands of years.

### Seyllin II

Seyllin II is an unremarkable barren planet. Because of its closeness to
the Seyllin sun, it is a hot, blasted world. Prior to the stellar
ejection, surface temperatures were nearly as hot as on Seyllin I. They
have dropped since the change in the star's luminosity, but still make
the surface inhospitable. Unlike Seyllin I, the planet does not possess
rich deposits, and has not been exploited in any major sense.

### Seyllin III

Despite being a temperate world, Seyllin III is not home to any life.
Because it was bombarded by heavy amounts of solar radiation for nearly
a billion years, life was never able to form on its surface. Thus it
does not have a breathable atmosphere, though it does have large surface
oceans. Under natural conditions, the planet would have been destroyed
by the star's supernova or, barring that, eventually lost the majority
of its atmosphere and surface water and become a barren planet.

With the change in luminosity of the star, it is uncertain what will
happen with the planet. There is the possibility of life eventually
forming on the planet, but no one is sure if the star will stabilize or
become less luminous or even expand into a red giant and devour the
planet.

### Seyllin IV

A gravitational magmatic, Seyllin IV is constantly subject to intense
turmoil that keeps it heated and hot. Combined with its closeness to a
former Type-O star, the planet was never able to cool sufficiently to
form a surface crust. Geologists suspect that thanks to the drop in the
star's luminosity, Seyllin IV will finally be able to cool sufficiently
so its gravitational energy will not be enough to keep it superheated.
This process will take millions of years, however, as the planet
maintains a large amount of stored internal heat.

### Seyllin V

Another blasted, barren rock, Seyllin V has very little of interest.
When the local star was a Type-O, it was subject to intense radiation
and heat. Following the stellar ejection, the planet receives a much
lesser bombardment and has cooled significantly. Because it maintains no
atmosphere to trap heat, the planet is now much cooler, which has caused
large cracks to form over the planet as its surface has contracted.

### Seyllin VI

The thick atmosphere of Seyllin VI's trapped the heat of the O-type
star, turning it into a roiling mass of superheated gas. Intense plasma
storms rage over the planet's surface, leaving it a lump of semi-molten
rock. The storms disrupt electronics, even those that are heavily
shielded, making exploration and exploitation of the planet difficult.

With the drop in luminosity of the local star, it is expected that
Seyllin VI will slowly cool. However, because its thick atmosphere
creates an intense greenhouse, this process is likely to take thousands
of years to complete.

### Seyllin VII

Much like its terrestrial twin of Seyllin III, Seyllin VII has surface
water and a significant atmosphere, but because of solar radiation, life
never had the chance to form. The atmosphere is composed mostly of
nitrogen and carbon dioxide as a result. Had nature been allowed to take
its course, it would have been destroyed in the sun's supernova before
any biological processes could have begun.

The drop in the star's luminosity has changed its fate entirely, though
life still seems unlikely. Instead, the planet is far outside the sun's
new habitability zone. As the planet's atmosphere slowly loses heat, it
is expected that the planet will cool and eventually become covered in
glaciers. This process is expected to take several decades to complete.

Outer Planets
-------------

### Seyllin VIII

Even when its star was Type-O, Seyllin VIII was a fairly standard gas
giant. It received a good deal of heat, but was far enough to not become
a pegasean planet. With the drop in its stars luminosity, it has cooled
further. It is currently harvested for helium and hydrogen.

### Seyllin IX

A distantly orbiting gas giant, Seyllin IX was the planet least directly
affected by the stellar ejection of its star. However, it may be the
planet most impacted long term, as astrophysicists believe that within
ten thousand years, the planet will be ejected from the system due to
the star's drop in mass.
