### Drifter Activity Dies Down

Cheers rang out across New Eden as news spread of the Drifter Crisis coming to an end. On YC127-05-15, preliminary reports indicated an almost complete cessation of Drifter activity in the occupied wormholes. Research provided by the Society of Conscious Thought yesterday shows a sudden severance of the connections between the Warden, the structure in Zarzakh that The Deathless retains sole access to, and the Drifter Nexuses. Consequently, Drifters have drawn back their forces. While they remain a threat to New Eden, it is widely believed that their resources have been greatly depleted by the Crisis.

Idemi Sver, the Society’s CEO, passionately added the following when providing the research data:

“As we celebrate the end of a calamity that the Deathless Circle themselves caused, can we afford to sit back and let them continue to have unfettered access to what we now know is dangerous technology? Had the SOCT been in control of the Warden, we would have prevented the Drifter connection from having been established at all. Failing that, I assure you we would have resolved the issue in days, not weeks, and without requiring assistance from the major factions or capsuleers. If we are to ensure that another Crisis does not occur, The Deathless’ technological tyranny over Zarzakh must come to an end.”

### Tension Rise Over First Policy of the Drifter Summit Proposal

When Drifter activity ceased, the five factions occupying Drifter wormholes, each of which successfully maintained control, took the opportunity to transport large Drifter structures from the Hives to their occupation sites. Extensive research on these structures is presumed to be underway.

The Society, having just revealed its own findings regarding the severance of the Warden connections, sent along with the data a reminder of the adopted EDENCOM proposal for open sharing of research.

The reminder was reportedly met with bristling remarks from faction leadership.

- The Convocation of Triglav has allegedly approached Caldari and Amarr representatives directly, rejecting the thought of sharing information with the unproven.

- The Caldari’s Chief Executive Panel did not comment when queried but informed us that they were actively seeking legal counsel.

- The Amarr herald waxed poetic, ending her lengthy sermon-esque response with a line about keeping research and knowledge confined to those deserving.

- Minmatar and EDENCOM authorities expressed disappointment with the other occupying forces’ sudden reticence and willingness to ignore the will of New Eden.

After the first Summit proposal was swiftly shut down amid fears that rival factions might gain strategically valuable information, public confidence in the remaining two proposals surviving New Eden’s harsh political landscape has faltered.

The NEN will continue to closely follow any developments regarding the Summit’s policies.

### Gallente Political Turmoil Continues

As the most populous faction not occupying a Drifter wormhole and therefore excluded from the Drifter Summit, the Gallente Federation’s citizenry reacted strongly to images of Drifter structures positioned near Caldari military installations, sparking renewed protests aimed at President Celes Aguard over the potential technological advantages this may provide.

Protesters are also expressing growing frustration over the continued absence of election news, particularly now that the Drifter Crisis, the official reason for the postponement, appears to have ended.

### News in Brief

- The Deepflow has become less volatile, according to reliable scientific sources.

- Drifter Wormhole filaments no longer function, due to the Warden-Nexuses connection being severed.

- Amarr and Minmatar forces exchanged blows and systems, Sosala going to the Empire and Vard to the Republic.

- Capsuleer-run EVE University, through Project Firebird, begin their overhaul of their long-standing capsuleer databank.

- Large groups of dreadnoughts and capital ships have been spotted moving from Fountain to an undisclosed location.
