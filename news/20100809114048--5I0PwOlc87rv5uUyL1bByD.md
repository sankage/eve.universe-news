 **Jita, The Forge** \- On 112.08.07, a Kestrel frigate carrying 74 Pilot's License Extensions [PLEX] worth about 22 billion ISK, was blown up just outside of the Jita 4-4 station.  
  
The frigate, piloted by Aystra of SpaceMonkey's Alliance, was destroyed by slickdog and Viktor Vegas of The 0rphanage Alliance as part of a CONCORD sanctioned war between the two entities. It remains unclear why the frigate pilot took the risk to move such a valuable cargo during an active war.  
  
According to wilbongbe of the SpaceMonkey's Alliance, we might never know the reasons behind the attempted move, as the weight of the tremendous ISK loss pushed Aystra to immediately put an end to her capsuleering days.  
  
The attacking pilots were unaware of the precious cargo and they immediately eliminated the wreck to deny any theft by scavenger pilots.  
  
"I would probably be kicked out [of the alliance] if [PLEX] were to drop... I was the one that killed the wreck," concluded slickdog.
