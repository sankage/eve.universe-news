**Alain Embrosius Topher** has a degree in applied physics and experimental psychology from the [University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM) on [Gallente Prime](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a). Topher, a brilliant but unruly student, signed up with an exploration company after his graduation and spent the next 20 years roaming around remote solar systems collecting astrophysical data. He has always been enthusiastic about foreign and alien cultures and the main reason for his exploration scurries was the hope to discover alien artifacts. Until now he has not found any artifacts older than a few thousand years of age and all which are of obvious human origin.

Having amassed a sizable sum during his days with the exploration company, Topher finally decided to try his luck on his own and spent the next few years combing several promising systems. Working alone, or at most with a couple of assistants, made these excursions highly dangerous, and thus prime entertainment material. Topher made a deal with one of the largest entertainment network in the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) to make vid programs about his adventures. These became hugely popular for a while, but the lack of bug-eyed monsters or glittering treasures soon turned the public indifferent. Topher, who had thrived in the limelight, decided to shelve his excursions for a while in favor of taking more exciting (and lucrative) excursions in vid studios.

Topher was content to live the life of a vid star for some years, but in the end the scientist in him begged for attention. Feeling too old to start running around barren planets again, Topher settled instead on making education shows and info clips, often in the form of games of some sort. Yet again he hit the jackpot and for billions of Gallente Topher is a household name associated with education and knowledge.

Now in his early nineties, Topher is finally settling down to a quiet academic life. His vid appearances are now few and far between and instead he's focusing on pure science more or less for the first time in his life. Long regarded among his fellow scientists as a stylish quack with a lot of weird ideas, his recent studies and papers have earned him long-overdue respect.
