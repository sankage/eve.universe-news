LUMINAIRE - After a turbulent morning, Federation Stock Exchange have halted all trading in shares and derivatives until further notice.   
  
The first reports from Seyllin had sent the Gallente mining shares down, as investors attempted to get to grips with the current situation. As details emerged, it became clear the market had experienced one of the most volatile and chaotic trading sessions to date.   
  
"It was insane," said Loita Exaio, a broker at Garoun Investment Bank. "I have not seen anything like that since the start of the war. People were acting without any semblance of rational behavior, and, frankly speaking, I can understand that."  
  
Although no timeline was given, trading is not expected to resume until tomorrow.
