# Iyen-Oursta
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/iyen-oursta

Iyen-Oursta was the site of the second largest (possibly
pre-[capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) era) battle in the history of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), the climactic battle between the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy).

It is now better known for the local phenomenon known as
[Lutins](4QBHzmS7145cgUWIpghBqV), which is generally considered a good omen
by all, though different races have different interpretations for it.
