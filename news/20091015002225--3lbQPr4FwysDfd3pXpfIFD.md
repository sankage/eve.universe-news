After a [recent Scope article](http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3367&tid=2) was released mentioning the damage done to many agricultural plantations within the Ammatar Mandate during the Elder Invasion of YC110 by a Minmatar-Thukker slave recovery force, capsuleers of the G.A.N.J.A. corporation were quick to demonstrate their outrage publicly in a non violent protest.  
  
Kimberly Hughes, spokesperson for G.A.N.J.A. described the protest: "We simply assembled into The Scope HQ located at planet VI, moon 1 in Orvolle, undocked and then destroyed our ships. Once we had destroyed a ship, we re-docked, jumped into a new ship, undocked and destroyed ourselves again." The protest cost the corporation 73 ships and at least one pod.[![Kimberly Hughes](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/3452/kimberlythumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=)  
  
Although this was a non-violent protest, Kimberly warned that: "In terms of next moves, well. We do have a more military action prepared and this will be a direct military action against the Minmatar State... we are not interested in the low life Minmatar people right now, that should be clear. At the moment our target is purely the State Officals. But if they fail to deliver our demands, then yes, the people will be targeted too, and the blood will be on the Minmatar States hands, as we've been as lenient as possible."  
  
G.A.N.J.A. believes that the Minmatar-Thukker force could not have been assembled without the support of Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor and Grarnelbrurgar Istrylere, the CEO of the Republic Justice Department. Kimberly states that: "The only thing that will stop G.A.N.J.A now, is the imprisonment of Malaetu Shakor and resignation of Grarnelbrurgar Istrylere as well as compensation to the farmers, that's very important."  
  
With no formal response received from the Minmatar government, G.A.N.J.A. has planned another non violent protest in the system of Rens on October 17th. They are hoping to draw more protesters in an attempt to make the government sit up and take notice.
