# Amarr Succession
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/amarr-succession

The **Amarr Succession** is a series of rituals to select an [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) after the previous emperor dies.

The rituals occur in a strict order and take a few weeks to complete.
Their exact, specific nature is unknown, only that they mainly involve
various ways the [Amarr Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) prove their
loyalty and worth to lead the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo).

Most of the rituals involve the Heirs directly, though in recent times
they have allowed for the naming of individual champions. The selection
of proper champions has come to be seen as an essential part of the
trials.

Following the selection of a new Emperor, the other four challengers
must commit [ritual suicide](7uCmeRGL3bgVWlEWQ9TZQb) in order to
minimize the risk of challenges to the Emperor's authority from the old
Privy Council. This ritual suicide has been
broken twice, once by [Khanid II](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf) following the
selection of [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV) and once in YC105 by [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L).
