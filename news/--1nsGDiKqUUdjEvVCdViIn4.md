March, YC111
============

Before Seyllin
--------------

March YC111 was to be
dominated by one event and its aftermath above all others: the
[Seyllin](1SX3stmn3UJS4nAXLNeUsG) Disaster. In itself, what happened in
Seyllin was one catastrophic effect of a much more profound and
widespread phenomenon: the emergence of unstable wormholes across the
[New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) cluster. The long-term effects
of that emergence can only be guessed at but it was Seyllin, with its
almost inconceivable human tragedy, that gripped New Eden before the
wider impact of the events of that day began to be comprehended.

Before Seyllin, however, the month began with the affairs of the empires
playing out much as they had done in previous weeks. In the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp), continued pressures in the troubled
polity led to charges of political stasis being leveled at
[Sanmatar](180IYq6xQy0PzfGH6hLEuO) [Maleatu Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV) amid chaotic and fractious scenes in
the [Republic Parliament](2EcbNQu5ua4Jjt3TTM0CvW). An attempted
amendment on a financial motion that attacked the Sanmatar's assumption
of powers was heavily defeated by a majority of the members present but
served as an indication of increasing disquiet at the uncertain
political situation.

The Sanmatar may have felt that his call soon after for an Assembly of
the Seven Tribes of Minmatar answered any such charges as had been aired
during the turbulent parliamentary session. This was swiftly followed by
a stunning political development as the Sanmatar and
[Thukker](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z) Chief Einnar Aeboul were able to
jointly announce that the Thukker Tribe, long estranged from the other
tribes, was to join the Minmatar Republic with full autonomy in the
[Great Wildlands](great-wildlands). An emotional
Maleatu Shakor was able to declare that "the Seven Tribes of Matar are
once more unified." The details of this union and the changing political
structure of the Minmatar Republic, now being spoken of as a "Tribal
Republic," were clearly to be major agenda items of the Tribal Assembly
that Shakor had called for only days before.

In the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK),
[Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn) Senator Suvio Bellaron proposed a ban on
public executions following the [Eturrer](4ft267N4XjELE5by1uHCt5)
execution. Senator Bellaron condemned the execution as "a shameful and
barbaric spectacle" when introducing his bill. Others criticized
Bellaron and noted the scale of Eturrer's treason. The bill was
effectively killed through procedural devices. In [Black Rise](black-rise) region, scene of intense warfare between
the Gallente Federation and [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy), the
[Kaalakiota Corporation](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK) announced a
large-scale surveying program aimed at locating resources and potential
colonization sites in the region. This was soon followed by
announcements from [Lai Dai](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT)
for development in Black Rise and clear positioning by
[Wiyrkomi](66psXtrftjRzA7MyKHtb7K) and
[Sukuuvestaa](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB) for future Black Rise
projects.

In the [Ammatar Mandate](4BV4ldw5RdVB4FxKctn4J6), Grand Admiral
Einkur Aro, former head of the [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) Fleet,
pleaded guilty to charges of dereliction of duty and treason and was
sentenced to death by a panel of [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) Justices headed by [Royal Heir](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) [Yonis Ardishapur](4Tb1Uk75SycuFuiizODkZD). In addition, Admiral Aro's
family was ordered to be enslaved. There was some protest at the
severity of the sentence but Einkur Aro himself remained impassive and
there was order as he was led from the courtroom to await execution a
week later.

111.03.10 - The Seyllin Disaster and Emergence of unstable wormholes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### First Indications

 The first indications that anything
unusual might happen on 111.03.10 were a series of communications
disruptions early in the day. First there came a report of travel delays
in Seyllin system, Essence region caused by the disruption of the
system's "[Cassandra](47YuBR3HlvNeGKVgVupGVx)" solar weather monitoring
network. Shortly after this, contact was lost with an
[ORE](38pEfgwJxyeFUuqMgpTLZ) survey expedition in 3HQC-6
system in [Outer Ring](76XHDOSsVTEcKoz8b0QuNt) region. Of course, nobody
connected the two incidents, happening as they did so far apart and
occasional disruptions of the kind were hardly unknown. An entire planet
dropping out of contact was, on the other hand, rather unusual and when
the [FTL link](slULqrFiu06fLmeraX1QL) with the planet
of [Seyllin I](rcmhOIWig0zQ49j4fNF7m) and the rest of the [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) was inexplicably lost it caused real
concern.

With planetary FTL [fluid routers](4w6FgQepyWkx0g0zXZctHM) typically
being among the most secure and hardened of installations - and Seyllin
I's were reported to be located several kilometers beneath the surface
of the planet - the sudden loss of contact seemed mysterious and
worrying enough for Gallente President [Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) to order the mobilization of
so-called ["Tripwire"](YZKlsxmTbVhuLskRwPmlL) defenses across the border separating the
Federation from the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy). Justified as a
"precautionary" measure, the mobilization nevertheless triggered a
response in kind from the Caldari, as their forces adopted a heightened
defensive posture along the border. Within the hour, Caldari State
Executor [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG) had issued a statement in
which he said that the Caldari deployment was purely in response to the
activation of Gallente border forces and denied the presence of any
Caldari forces in the vicinity of Seyllin.

### Solar Pulse

When communications with Seyllin I were restored a half-hour later all
emergency channels immediately flooded with planetary distress calls.
With distress signals originating from all four primary cities of the
planet \- Loadcore, Metal City, Southern Cross and Valimor \- it became
clear that planetary communications systems had restarted autonomously
following a protective shutdown against an external threat. With the
cities of the barren mining planet all located underground, speculation
as to the nature of the threat was widespread and only fueled by
continuing distress calls, many calling for evacuation of the planet.
Speculation turned to alarm when an automated distress signal from a
ground-level installation on Seyllin I indicated a possible nuclear
attack underway. With [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) and Federation
warships scrambling for the system, authorities called for calm and
refused to confirm that an attack had been launched, noting that the
early-warning system could be triggered by other environmental events
aside from a nuclear strike. 
However,
further distress signals from Seyllin indicated that many injuries
consistent with exposure high levels of radiation were being reported.
The first messages received were determined to have originated from the
daytime side of Seyllin I near the city of Loadcore, although
communications with the day side of the planet were reportedly being
routed through underground links to the night side. Direct
communications with day-side cities and installations remained massively
disrupted and effectively impossible. With radiation burns and poisoning
continuing to be reported it became clear that a radiological event had
taken place and the fear that a nuclear attack had been carried out
continued to grow.

These fears were allayed somewhat when scientists at a hastily-arranged
emergency conference in Bourynes declared that a "solar radiological
pulse" originating from the powerful blue sun of Seyllin system was the
cause of the catastrophe. The [University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM) conference further ruled out
any kind of military attack or nuclear strike, noting that no weapons
available to any state in the cluster could have delivered almost
instantaneous planetary-wide devastation reaching into the deep
subterranean cities of Seyllin I. While this may have been regarded as
good news by some, the scientists were not sanguine about the chances
for survival of anyone caught on the surface of the planet, and even
more ominously were unable to rule out the possibility that the Seyllin
sun had gone nova. Even though the O-class star would not have been
expected to enter the post-main sequence period for another million
years, the evidence was that the planet had been doused in massive
bursts of ultraviolet light and high-energy particles consistent with a
nova or similar solar event.

While events at Seyllin were ongoing, [the Scope](2XUuFn5Lte67YYxmxj86Yt)
reported that a [Thukker](3uoxvtJY1Z30BoVwuJLj2z) Great Caravan had
been reported missing in the Great Wildlands region after passing
through the SL-YBS system. For one of the vast, hundreds-of-ships-strong
Great Caravans to simply disappear was so unusual that the Thukker were
reported to be urgently consulting with the Minmatar Republic's Sanmatar
Maleatu Shakor. Additionally, Outer Rings Excavations confirmed that
their deep-core survey expedition operating in 3HQC-6 system had been
lost. Most significantly, the team had been working on the first planet
of the system and reported a "possible nuclear strike or other
radiological pulse weapon" detonation near their location shortly before
all contact with them was lost. The similarities with the Seyllin event
were lost on no-one and ORE immediately began sharing data with the
scientists at Bourynes.

### Panic Spreads

As panic began to spread around the Gallente Federation - one serious
incident being a stampede at the Oursulaert III [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) Testing Facilities station - the
first Federation and CONCORD warships arrives in orbit around Seyllin I.
They were met by a scene of devastation and CONCORD officials confirmed
that a "natural disaster of unprecedented scale and consequence had
occurred." The Federation Navy announced it was bringing in
[dropship](4wZzQQw2pCVTwh0vgiWEv8) squadrons for evacuation of the wounded
by carrier, and that many other capital ships and freighters were en
route bringing supplies and intending to operate as orbital triage
centers. 

Shortly after the
arrival of the warships at Seyllin, President Souro Foiritan and CONCORD
Chief of Staff Kivas Odaka held a joint news conference confirming that
a radiological pulse had emanated from the sun of Seyllin system and
impacted on Seyllin I. The statement confirmed that the "Cassandra"
weather monitoring system had gone offline at 08:41
[EST](2cJeP2eBHll85PfjQlTtHt), followed by the shutdown of fluid
routers across Seyllin I at 08:49 EST, apparently as the pulse struck
the planet. At 08:59 EST, communications with the city of Southern Cross
were restored and it had been determined that the pulse had disabled the
planetary communications network, incapacitated the global power grid
and destroyed or heavily damaged any equipment on or below the surface
of the planet to a depth of 20 meters.

Importantly, President Foiritan emphasized that the pulse was not an
attack by any nation and appeared to be a singular solar event with an
unknown cause. Given the high level of damage, he had issued an
executive order to evacuate Seyllin I and had appointed Grand Admiral
Anteson Ranchel to oversee the operation. CONCORD forces would be
assisting in the evacuation and that dropships would be ferrying
evacuees from the night-side cities of Southern Cross and Valimor. The
cities of Loadcore and Metal City would not be directly evacuated and
citizens were advised to use magrail lines operating on backup power to
reach the night-side cities.

As the magnitude of the events in Seyllin became understood, together
with a few indications that the solar radiological pulse was by no means
an isolated occurrence, so did panic rise across New Eden. In the
Gallente Federation, increasing numbers of crowd panic incidents were
reported and the stock markets began to fluctuate. In particular, the
stock prices of the Gallente mining sector tumbled as the impact of the
loss of Seyllin I, a major Federation mining planet, began to be felt.
In the Caldari State, many citizens in colonies along the border with
the Federation began to take to emergency shelters on the outskirts of
cities and other settlements. Fear of war with the Federation appeared
to be the main reason for the flight to the shelters and the authorities
in some colonies were reported to be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of
people flooding in.

### Situation Worsens

While the wider reaction appeared to become more hysterical, the
situation on Seyllin I lurched into chaos despite the presence of many
freighters and capital vessels operating as medical triage centers and
support ship for squadrons of dropships. The rush of Seyllin I's
inhabitants to get off the devastated world soon resulted in tragedy as
two overloaded Federation Navy dropships collided on take-off, killing
all aboard and many in the waiting crowds of refugees. An estimated
4,000 were killed in this disaster and Federation Marines were quick to
move in and place cordons around all loading bays to establish order and
prevent further overloading of dropships. The desperation of the crowds
only intensified as distress signals and footage of the horrors of
Seyllin I, particularly from the day-side cities, were received and
re-transmitted in their hundreds across the planet and beyond.

Despite the extraordinary news of
the [Serpentis Corporation](64u7D7YksvODwmCFL3llMs), despite
its longstanding enmity with the Federation, sending medical equipment
and personnel to Seyllin, alongside specialized excavation and rescue
equipment from ORE, the overall situation appeared to worsen by the
minute. When the Scope obtained and transmitted a feed of President
Foiritan imploring the people of Metal City and Loadcore to use the
magrail system to move to safety, rather than wait to be rescued, it
became clear that the effort to evacuate some half a billion inhabitants
from the planet was becoming increasingly desperate.

In response to the crisis the Gallente charity Renyn Relief, itself
based in Essence region, announced an emergency aid response for Seyllin
I. The charity dispatched all its available vessels to Seyllin, with
several freighters laden with medicine and other supplies sent on their
way to the stricken planet. Elsewhere in New Eden a rather less
charitable response to the tragic events of Seyllin came from the Amarr
Empire when a fundamentalist groups, the God's Righteousness Conclave,
transmitted a statement calling the solar event "God's cleansing fire."
Claiming the disaster to be foretold by scripture, the Conclave claimed
it was the consequence of "heresy" and a "vengeance" on the Gallente
Federation, described as "the heretic nation."

### Evidence of Wider Events

Late in the morning by standard time, more evidence of the wider and
more profound nature of the events of the day came to light as an
[Intaki Syndicate](4ODncOn9Yvcol1oPLyHrFk) Bureau station orbiting at
16AUs from the sun of the 35-RK9 system was struck by a radiological
pulse. This was the third confirmed solar event of the type to occur
that morning. Fortunately, the considerable distance of the station from
the sun appeared to result in the pulse hitting the station much less
strongly and the shields were reported to have held, despite many
electrical and electronic systems being knocked out. As this news was
being digested, the Scope broke a story that CONCORD probes
investigating the Seyllin sun had disappeared and had apparently been
destroyed on approach to the star. The DED was reported as having
detained the journalist breaking the story and CONCORD itself refused to
discuss the story or confirm the detention of the reporter.

Despite the clear and
increasing evidence that Seyllin had been the site of an extraordinary
yet naturally-occurring event that was not even isolated, anti-Caldari
demonstrations began to flare up across the Federation. Even the
statements of President Foiritan had not been enough to allay fears and
dispell suspicions among many that the Caldari had struck at the
Federation using a diabolical new weapon. Perhaps mindful that his words
would not be enough, as well as requiring more ships to relieve Seyllin,
President Foiritan soon recalled the Federation Navy ships deployed
along the border with the Caldari State. The Caldari, for their part,
made no immediate move to mirror this action.

In a sign of the increasing tendency to blame any unusual occurrence on
the mysterious but deadly new phenomena apparently afflicting stars
across the cluster, an [Amarr Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g) report that
contact had been lost with one of their scout patrols in the border
system of Kourmonen caused some consternation. The local Navy commander
placed his fleet on high alert and this in turn triggered a matched
response from [Republic Fleet](2c4ZwKPnuW6mYkLJ2dGh94) vessels in
neighboring Auga. However, within the hour contact with the patrol had
been re-established and the ships recovered with no loss and seemingly
having suffered nothing akin to the radiological pulses reported
elsewhere in New Eden. No hostile action by other nations or military
forces was evident on the Amarr-Minmatar border but both sides remained
at high alert following the incident.

### "They're Dead Already"

On Seyllin I, the situation continued to deteriorate. Shortly after noon
EST, the magrail link between Loadcore and Southern Cross failed,
trapping thousands of refugees in transit deep underground and making
the job of evacuating Loadcore vastly more difficult. Rescue teams on
Seyllin I described the situation as "hell" and it was reported that
many rescuers were receiving high doses of radiation while working on
the planet. Radiation poisoning was the subject of a leaked radio
communication by a Federation disaster relief official. The official was
heard saying "they're dead already, they just don't know it" in
reference to survivors from the day side of the planet showing signs of
receiving high doses of radiation. The grim prospect of the evacuation
of people doomed to die anyway transfixed news audiences across New
Eden.

In the Minmatar Republic the disappearance of a Great Caravan - later
revealed to be the important Lakat-Hro caravan - took precedence over
all. Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor announced that the the ability of the
Republic to respond to the Seyllin disaster was minimal while [Republic Fleet](2c4ZwKPnuW6mYkLJ2dGh94) assets were diverted to the search for
the missing Great Caravan. Coordinating the effort to find the caravan
last known to be in SL-YBS system, the Trust Partners corporation
organized a huge effort by Republic and Thukker ships to quarter a large
volume of space centered on the last checkpoint made by the Lakat-Hro
caravan. Many more Republic squadrons were sent to this effort as the
Minmatar focused on recovering their Thukker brethren.

Elsewhere, with the Empress perhaps
concerned that the religious radicals of the God's Righteousness
Conclave not be seen to speak for Amarr, the office of [Imperial Chancellor](7GOV3morIu47J3BmidrhU8) [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV) issued a communique offering
assistance to the Gallente Federation at the order of Empress [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L). While the communique stated that natural
phenomena are the work of God, it took the line that the Seyllin event
was a "test of faith" rather than a divine punishment, as the Conclave
had asserted. In a rather pungent twist, the fleet recently removed from
Royal Heir [Uriam Kador's](7LJKelrqDXAAUYi6o48Uno) control - a fleet
that had invaded the Gallente Federation less than six months before -
was placed on 30 minute's notice to provide assistance should President
Foiritan request it.

On the planet of Villore VII, anti-Caldari protestors were dispersed by
local police as they turned to throwing stones at the Caldari consulate.
The police used tear gas and sonic grenades to disperse the rioters
before the situation got out of control. Authorities assured the
citizenry that the Seyllin events were not attributable to the Caldari
State and peace was swiftly restored. Notwithstanding the anti-Caldari
flareups in the Federation, Caldari State Executor Tibus Heth finally
responded to the withdrawal of Federation warships from the border by
standing down the [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) from its
heightened defensive posture. The Caldari State also repeated an offer
of assistance to the Federation.

The Federation Stock Exchange in Luminaire ceased trading until further
notice in the afternoon as it became clear that the turbulence of the
morning trading session would continue without intervention. Meanwhile,
the Gallente Federation's emergency infrastructure braced itself for a
severe overload as refugees from Seyllin I began to be shipped away from
the planet and out of system. The biggest concern amongst disaster
management officials was the very large numbers of people suffering from
varying degrees of irradiation. Concerns grew that, if the proportions
of radiation poisoning seen among the relatively few evacuated thus far
held true for the entire population, existing stockpiles of radiation
treatment drugs would be totally inadequate.

### Zero Hour

Unfortunately, all concerns over coping with half a billion evacuees
were eclipsed by news of a "large, superheated mass' heading towards
Seyllin I. The shocking story also revealed that CONCORD were tracking
the mass and had established a "Zero Hour", or time of impact, by which
all ships were under orders to have left the vicinity of the planet. the
Scope broke this news despite attempts by CONCORD to suppress the facts
and the detention of several of the news agency's staff. The news that a
potentially world-shattering plasma wave was approaching the planet sent
Seyllin I into a mass panic. Some spaceports were forced to cease
handling dropships as bordering gantries were overrun and in some cases
collapsed as hysterical crowds fought for space aboard transports off
the planet. CONCORD condemned the Scope for publishing the new and
called Chief Editor Lars Kiormen's report "impetuous, inflammatory and
irresponsible." 

Despite the panic amongst many residents, several journalists trapped on
Seyllin reported that in the deepest city caverns an eerie calm had
descended. Many citizens had apparently resigned themselves to their
fate and decided to spend their last moments alive in peace, enjoying
the company of their loved ones. With news agencies broadcasting
emotional farewell messages to their staff and continuing to carry
reports of an oncoming plasma wave, CONCORD and the Federation Navy
ceased to co-operate with journalists. The approximate count of Seyllin
I residents safely evacuated by this time, early afternoon EST, was
843,000.

With scientists openly speculating on the nature of the superheated mass
rushing towards Seyllin I, with most concluding that a vast plasma wave
had been unleashed from the system sun, the desperation on the planet
increased. It was reported that Federation Marines had opened fire on
crowds attempting to rush dropships at the spaceports remaining open and
able to service evacuation transports. Outrage was provoked by the
evacuation of convicted prisoners off the planet while millions upon
millions of innocent citizens remained below. The withdrawal of
starships from Seyllin I orbit began, with medical vessels and triage
centers moving off. Roden Shipyards and CreoDron announced that they had
hardened the defenses of their stations in Seyllin but would remain open
for new docking for as long as possible. With it noted that full
defensive measures would require the stations to seal and deny all
traffic, CONCORD and the Federation Navy declined to comment on the
safety of the stations.

By 14:30 EST, it was clear that a mass exodus of ships away from the
orbit of Seyllin I and out of the system was underway. the Scope
reported that its news-gathering vessels were fired on by Federation
Navy warships as they attempted to defy system-wide evacuation orders.
These ships left the system under duress but were able to report that
all dropships had left Seyllin I and the planetary evacuation had
effectively ended. Blockades of entry points into Seyllin from the
adjacent systems of Aporulie, Ane and Metserel were put in place by
large formations of CONCORD ships. "Zero Hour" had arrived.

### Seyllin Lost

Shortly after 14:35 EST, all
contact with Seyllin system was lost as the stargates leading into the
system were shutdown. Fluid router signals out of the system were
interrupted and all automated distress signals from Seyllin I abruptly
ceased. In the face of this terrible silence a dreadful realization
dawned across New Eden.

With the blockade of Seyllin being maintained by CONCORD as a
precaution, other developments across the cluster came to the fore.
Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor had announced the destruction of the Thukker
Great Caravan Lakat-Hro and confirmed that a "solar event similar in
scale and power to that described in Seyllin" had been the cause of
the loss. This announcement had brought the number of near-simultaneous
main-sequence solar anomalies occurring that day to four. This evidence
of a cluster-wide phenomenon underway only stoked the already heightened
popular fear of an armageddon-scale catastrophe afflicting all of New
Eden.

To the repugnance of many, the God's Righteousness Conclave had issued a
fresh statement warning of dire consequences for those assisting the
population of Seyllin I. The Conclave claimed that "those lost in the
Seyllin system shall serve as a stark reminder of both the glory and
power of God." The Amarr government refused to comment on the statement
and referred all reporters to the official position of the Empress and
the offer of support made by the Empire to the Federation.

### Wormhole Warning

Of more profound importance was the warning issued by the Servant
[Sisters of EVE](2eTQAT2DL0C7TWVtkOr8pN) that they had detected signs
of unstable wormhole formation throughout the New Eden cluster. The
Sisters claimed that "multiple instances of defect-mediated turbulence
in the fabric of spacetime had been detected in various locations
throughout the cluster," and went on to note that the sightings
coincided with "the erratic behavior of multiple star systems ...
all throughout New Eden."

In layman's terms, the reclusive humanitarian and scientific
organization was saying that they were forecasting the formation of many
wormholes across New Eden and that this formation appeared to coincide
with stellar events such as those witness in Seyllin and at least three
other systems that day. That the Sisters referred to many "unreported"
events of that type caused some consternation but the Sisters addressed
the dangers of the wormholes themselves, calling on CONCORD to issue
travel warnings to avoid such wormholes. With their expertise in the
field, based on many decades of research into the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o) and related matters, the Servant Sisters were
taken very seriously indeed.

### Aftermath of Seyllin

Shortly after 15:30 EST, the CONCORD and Federation forces guarding
Seyllin entry gates lifted the blockade while warning ships not to
approach Seyllin I itself. Within minutes, after confirmation by probes
of the status of Seyllin I, Gallente President Souro Foiritan addressed
the Federation and announced the total loss of the planet due toa main
sequence anomaly affecting the system's sun. With only a million or so
inhabitants evacuated from the planet, the President announced the death
of a half billion on Seyllin I with its effective destruction as a
stable body. Foiritan accepted responsibility for the decision to
withhold information during the evacuation and confirmed that the order
to detain reporters had been his own. Chief Editor Lars Kiormen was said
to be released, but has not been seen since.

the Scope soon established a live feed of the remnants of Seyllin I. The
scene showed clearly that a plasma wave had passed through the area and
showed the planet's remains slowly coalescing back into a sphere.
Massive fragments and ejecta were seen in orbit around the center of
gravity and capsuleers were noted inspecting the remains of the dead
world, despite CONCORD warnings of the extreme danger.

CONCORD also warned of the dangers of wormholes after confirming for
itself that the "topological space-time defects" predicted by the
Sisters of EVE were indeed wormholes appearing across the New Eden
cluster. While technically "unstable", in that these wormholes appeared
to be short-lived and subject to mass transfer effects, these "tunnels"
through space-time were reported to be sufficiently stable structurally
to enable vessels to traverse them. CONCORD declared itself unable to
protect those entering such portals and announced an "unenforceable
travel ban" to discourage pilots from exploring the wormholes.

### The Scramble for W-Space

It soon became clear that the "ban" would do little to dissuade would-be
explorers. [CreoDron](3lCriaLYr0Nrmj9pkru5Z3) announced their discovery of
a wormhole in an undisclosed system. The corporation's lead
astrophysicist, [Lianda Burreau](4YD4PXslOcnv8rY7av4vn2), announced
her opinion that a "stable wormhole" had been found by CreoDron in a
system that remained undisclosed. Professor Burreau refuted the CONCORD
advisory and ban, making clear that she intended to travel through this
new wormhole after having scouted the transit with long-range autonomous
drones. The CreoDron announcement prompted CONCORD to restate its
warnings and emphasized that all exploring such wormholes took such an
"extreme risk" solely on their own responsibility.

The CreoDron scout
drones sent through the apparently stable wormhole were soon
transmitting telemetry back to the Prof. Burreau's team, including image
data. The images showed a system with dark, empty planets set against a
background dominated by an unfamiliar and darkly crimson nebula.
Encouraged by the apparently normal orbital dynamics of the system, and
setting aside indications of abnormal electromagnetic fields, Prof.
Burreau maintained that she would be leading a manned excursion into the
unknown system.

Reactions to the CreoDron discovery and plans were immediate and
various. The deep space explorer Julien Sirrok warned that the CreoDron
expedition was taking a serious risk by relying on scout drone telemetry
to guide exploration of a new region of space. The [School of Applied Knowledge](1mpxZ1xQASwfKEIiB65lDW) urged CreoDron to
treat its discoveries as the collective property of all humanity. This
appeal was regarded by many commentators as naive, while others regarded
it with some cynicism given that a Caldari institution was making such
an appeal. Corporations such as Chemal Tech and Roden Shipyards,
meanwhile, began to make plans and allocate resources aimed at
replicating CreoDron's discovery.

Religious and spiritual reactions to the wormhole discoveries were no
less varied than the materialistic. The
[Sebiestor](1fNour0sFTIcCFRVQM2pro) spiritual leader [Vuld Haupt](1clrLuFFV50EpAEzxYx6Zt)
announced that he would be organizing an expedition to explore the
newly-emerging wormholes, describing them as the "paths of our
ancestors." The announcement prompted immediate comparisons with the
ill-fated "Bright Star" spiritual expedition of
[YC110](4s7KrRaqQANTatQhzlSaRi). In the Amarr Empire, [Sani Sabik](TDJbDXVg3cRp4b6FEkkFS) cults openly revealed themselves on
stations and in cities in reaction to the apparent discovery of a new
crimson nebula, interpreting it as a "cloud of blood" detailed in an
apocalyptic Sani Sabik prophecy. The Amarr [Ministry of Internal Order](5P4c9Lcr1rAUNd2Lb8gb3t) acted swiftly to remove
the cultists, described as "troublesome elements," from the streets of
the Empire.

### A Lost Civilization

If the initial data from CreoDron's scout drones was unusual, their
subsequent discoveries were nothing less than startling. When CreoDron's
drones identified "non-natural deadspace signatures" in the unknown
system on the other side of the wormhole discovered by Lianda Burreau's
team, the professor had lost no time in publicizing the news via the
Balrille constellation's liquid router network.

The news appeared to
galvanize New Eden's various empires and factions with the Sisters of
EVE, Amarr Navy and the Lai Dai Corporation all announcing plans to
mount expeditions into "W-Space", as the realm that many of the
wormholes appeared to lead to became known. The population of the
Gallente Federation were by now in a state of collective shock, stunned
by the Seyllin Disaster and its aftermath, and transfixed by the
discoveries being made about and within the newly-emerged wormholes.

The Federation authorities, however, took a highly precautionary line,
no doubt heeding CONCORD with whom they had been working hand-in-glove
throughout the day. Late evening reports had [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1) reserves seizing control of the secret
CreoDron site somewhere in the Balrille constellation. This was
apparently an attempt to forestall the Burreau expedition into the
Balrille wormhole but the intrepid professor had left some time before
the Navy's forces were able to lockdown the CreoDron facilities.

Upon hearing the news of the Federation Navy's actions, the [University of Caille](3yrFWFSjOxnFu1GTFhudTM) expressed their shock and
outrage at the seizure of CreoDron's facilities. Through its press
office, the University declared that the Navy's actions threatened "the
very foundation of our scientific research." University of Caille
scientists and other academics had been heavily involved with the day's
events concerning the "Seyllin Pulse" and were concerned that the Navy's
step would damage attempts to understand the possibly linked phenomena
that had been observed.

Late that night, the Federation Navy let it be known that all its
attempts to contact the Burreau expedition had failed. They also
revealed that contact with the scout drones that had preceded the
expedition had been lost as well. The Navy made no indication that it
intended to send a party into the wormhole in search of Professor
Burreau and her expedition team. With little more emerging and the Navy
being reticent on the subject, many assumed that the Burreau expedition
had met a grim fate and was lost somewhere in W-Space. The School of
Applied Knowledge declared that "despite the possible tragedy, the
exploration can continue and in fact, it must do so." The
indications from across New Eden, as planning an preparation for more
exploration continued, were that governments, corporations and academic
institutions were very broadly in agreement on that point.

The Burreau expedition proved to be the final drama of a very long day.
A day that could be claimed to rival even the cluster-shaking 110.06.10
for momentous impact and which may, in the final analysis, turn out to
have even more far-reaching implications for the future of the cluster.
Certainly, by any measure, 111.03.10 had surely established itself as a
historic day that would long be remembered in New Eden.

After 111.03.10

### W-Space exploration

Shocking as the Seyllin Disaster was, the sensational news that the new
wormholes were potential routes to another realm, containing traces of
an ancient civilization, seemed to push the catastrophe on the Gallente
planet into the background. Certainly, some
[capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) went to Seyllin to try and assist
with what remained of the evacuation of refugees from Seyllin's stations
and those ships that had remained in the system. Others went simply to
take a look at the shattered planet, marveling at the destruction
wrought by the superheated plasma burst that had radiated out from
Seyllin's sun.

Far more capsuleers acted as many non-capsuleer organizations did and
began to explore the potential of wormholes. As reports and rumours of
more and more expeditions to wormholes dominated the news feeds, it was
only within a few days that the first reported capsuleer starbase was
deployed in a W-Space system. (By now, the parlance "W-Space" for
wormhole space and "K-space" for known space had become current and
accepted.) As this was being reported, the Thukker caravans were said to
be taking the lead in the Minmatar's wormhole exploration efforts. The
expertise of the Thukker as explorers, and perhaps their wish to see
that the Lakat-Hro caravan had not been lost in vain, made them the
natural choice to spearhead Minmatar efforts in this area.

### Jarek's Pride

While the aftermath of Seyllin and the emergence of the wormholes
dominated March, events elsewhere continued. In the Minmatar Republic,
the Salvation Crusade was once more the focus of attention as [Abel Jarek](5HDj1enu8OW6rTNg6d9dR8) confessed to the "sin of pride" concerning
the chapel built by his followers on Matar and subsequently burned down
by rioters. The charismatic leader of the Salvation Crusade revealed
that he had meditated on the destruction of the chapel and concluded
that he was "not yet worthy to build a house for our Lord."

Still dogged by demonstrators and opposition among the general
population, the slave-based Amarr faith movement had also apparently
been the cause of difficulties with the Minmatar government for Aidonis
Medical, a charitable branch of the [Aidonis foundation](2ZdUwi6lEN75YZoamvXA72). The medical charity claimed that
it had been placed under "insidious pressure" to withdraw humanitarian
aid workers from the Salvation Crusade compound in the largest Matar
refugee camp. Tensions between Aidonis Medical and the Minmatar
government had already arisen over the handling of the humanitarian
situation in the refugee camps. The case of Dr. Arturio Kiervalani, a
volunteer medic with Aidonis Medical who had spoken about the
anti-Salvation Crusade rioting, also exacerbated matters. The revocation
of his license to practice medicine in the Republic was seen by the
charity as part of the "pressure" claimed to be under. For its part, the
Republic government denied the claims and refused to comment on the
Kiervalani case.

To the surprise of some, the next declaration by Abel Jarek was that he
intended to found a permanent community in Matar's remote Tronhadar
valley region. He consequently took over half of his followers,
including all the children and elderly among them, to the Tronhadar
where he founded the township of "Salvation" in the "unclaimed hills" of
the lower Tronhadar. The move caused considerable disquiet among the
[Krusual Tribe](7KI9OEieV9sdjksayCyoGk), with its ancestral holdings
in the mountains of the upper Tronhadar abutting the area where Jarek
established his "community of believers." Even though many of the
"crusaders" remained in the camps to preach and carry on the work of
conversion among refugees, those who had protested against Jarek and his
followers claimed that the controversial preacher had been driven to
"flee into the hills."

### Ardishapur and the Mandate

In the troubled Ammatar Mandate, Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur continued
to set his seal on the imperial province by appointing a new chief of
the [Ammatar Fleet](3as0Qu7kajUNvkjJdBSwF1). Elevating Admiral Hastar
Jibril of the [House Ardishapur](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) forces to
Grand Admiral of the Ammatar Fleet, the Royal Heir also set about
integrating units of his family's fleet into the Ammatar forces. The
heavy losses suffered by the Ammatar Fleet during the Elder Invasion, as
well as the desertions that followed, were to be made up in this way.
This also neatly allowed Yonis Ardishapur to comply with the reactivated
edict of [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV) banning personal fleets
while retaining control over a very large space navy.

Grand Admiral Hastar promptly set about implementing the merger of the
two forces and also issued a swathe of promotions across the Ammatar
Fleet, replacing many lost officers and NCOs while maintaining a balance
within the fleet by promoting a large number of Ammatar servicemen. In a
related matter, the family of the executed former Grand Admiral of the
Ammatar Fleet, Einkur Aro, was purchased by Arim Ardishapur, nephew and
Heir-apparent to Yonis Ardishapur, to serve as "favored" household
slaves.

### The Fall of Intaki

 The ongoing war between the
Caldari State and the Gallente Federation in the Black Rise region and
surrounding areas continued despite the tragedy of Seyllin. The Caldari
[State Protectorate](2VlyV0CDyxFv0Qg3N3dW8k) militia had made
advances in the Placid region and soon threatened to occupy the Intaki
system. The Federal Navy called on the Gallente [Federal Defense Union](5RoHHUZd3JdAg1HhBi5BAP) militia to make incursions into
the Inolari constellation in Black Rise as part of "Operation Justice's
Reach," an apparent effort to recover military equipment suspected to
have been stolen by Caldari forces in a raid on shipping in Caslemon.
The Caldari Navy dismissed this campaign as a "smokescreen" and indeed
neither FDU nor State Protectorate forces seemed inclined to take much
note of the call, preferring to concentrate on the offensive underway in
Placid.

Whether due to the Federation Navy's lack of focus, the FDU's
disorganization or the State Protectorate's single-minded efforts, the
Intaki system duly fell under Caldari occupation. With a major
Federation race's home system now under the control of the Caldari
State, a significant blow had been dealt to the Gallente. The occupation
of the system by Caldari forces led to much disruption on Intaki Prime,
with outbreaks of violence reported on the planet as pro-Federation,
pro-State and Intaki secessionist demonstrators took to the streets. The
ensuing clashes led to over a dozen deaths and hundreds injured. While
Intaki Prime remained under the control of its planetary government,
considerable confusion as to the intentions of the Caldari manifested
itself in concerns that a blockade, extended siege or even a full-scale
invasion might take place. The Intaki government made appeals for calm
and the well-respected Sadereron Idama, an Intaki spiritual leader,
urged Intaki citizens to keep to their homes.

While a major Federation system fell under Caldari occupation, the
Federal Intelligence Office internal security and counter-espionage
division known as the "[Black Eagles](6eVk3icIk4UHf5Uh799xDN)" raided
the offices of the Renyn Relief charity, based in the Essence region
system of Renyn. With the raids taking in the charity's offices in
war-torn Placid and the charity having been founded by a Caldari
prospector, Gaido Noreitta, with links to Outer Ring Excavations, it
seemed to some that the Federation's internal security force was placing
organizations run by expatriates under special scrutiny.
