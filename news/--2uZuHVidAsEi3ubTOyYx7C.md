# Spoke Bomb
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/spoke-bomb

The **spoke bomb** is a weaponizable tool used in rescue operations.

It consists of supercompressed constructs of interconnected tritanium
pins encased in an isolated chamber, with a small discharger set at
their center. When a spoke ruptures and the tritanium comes into contact
with air (or the encased backup pocket of oxygen contained within the
bomb), it expands violently, blowing away anything in its immediate
vicinity. The tritanium spokes click into place and form a complex
prismic polyhedron, similar to a hubless wheel. The spokes are perfectly
balanced, and effectively create a hole in a wall through which a person
can pass.

It should be noted that they are not biased in operation, and will not
distinguish between a hole created in a wall, a crumbling piece of metal
wreckage, or someone's torso.
