**War for Profit -** On Sunday 1st June, **STYX.** along with ally **Band Of Brothers** , made another concerted effort to take the dysprosium moon in **Ertoo** from Red Alliance. This time they succeeded.

STYX. Alliance had made two previous attempts to take the moon but were repelled both times with major losses, including the loss of 2 motherships. This time however, a fleet of approximately 150 vessels entered the Ertoo system and converged on the moon mining array and the supporting tower.

Lv Stein, a director of STYX. shared his feelings about the past failures and eventual success; _"We took heavy losses on [our] previous attempt[s] as you know, but our spirit was not broken. We were determined and came a lot more prepared...[We brought] more [of] everything, including more friends, the fleet was close to 150 pod pilots in different ship sizes and roles"_

A lot of effort has gone into securing this dysprosium moon for STYX. When asked why, Stein told us, _"Any effort to decrease RA ability to sustain long term war is worth it, no matter the cost. Losing 2 motherships so quickly always create[s] some effect, but was quickly overcome by the spirit of everyone involved."_

It may have taken them them a few attempts and a few billion ISK's worth of ships but STYX. have now taken one of the most profitable moons in New Eden, thus giving a major income boost to their alliance. More important to them however, is that they have deprived their enemy of a great prize.
