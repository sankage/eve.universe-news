# Crielere Research Laboratories
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/crielere-research-laboratories

The **Crielere Research Laboratories** were a joint scientific endeavor
between the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) and [Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK). The project was founded by Henric
Touvolle and [Taromi Umailen](DIS7xhmJ6Kk5JwiEh9uZ1) with heavy
involvement from [Duvolle Laboratories](1khBWLK52GfHvRQ1xUrOPb)
and [Ishukone Corporation](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI). During its
short existence, it was responsible for several important scientific
breakthroughs and was the center of massive controversy.

Crielere was the first to recognize the manufacturing potential of
Morphite. [Otro Gariushi](5QydCJCoYvbvbWvFlAlbHg), CEO of Ishukone,
pledged that the technology would be freely available to anyone who
wanted it.

Project termination

### Blueprint theft

In January YC106, several valuable blueprints
went missing from the Labs. Despite acknowledging the value of the
blueprints, Crielere command downplayed their theft. The theft prompted
a visit from President [Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt), who
launched an official investigation into the thefts. This investigation
concluded that top members of the Crielere project participated in the
theft, and it was eventually revealed that Otro Gariushi was the
mastermind behind the thefts. He justified his actions by stating the
Caldari were the driving force behind the project's successes. The
revelation caused the Federation [Senate](x8brOPuT22Bcly2Sikkt5) to withdraw
funding from the project, resulting in the shutdown of large parts of
the facility and the desertion of many scientists.

### First Guristas assault

The project's founders issued a call for harmony, but it went mostly
unheeded. The State and Federation withdrew all funding and pulled their
security forces from the project. Touvolle and Umailen barricaded
themselves inside with a group of loyal scientists and refused to
abandon the project. Almost immediately, the station was assaulted by
[Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) pirates.

Despite the absence of Federation or State security vessels, the station
survived the assault thanks to the actions of a hastily organized pod
pilot defense force. After several waves of fighting, the
[Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) were forced out of the system. However,
several scientists were killed in the fighting, including [Kaiman Gunaris](2SklUotgjPKc5SVtai901Z). The loss of life prompted many to
urge the remaining Crielere scientists to surrender.

Following the attacks, many scientists began openly selling formerly
classified blueprints on the open market.

### Second Guristas assault

The Guristas launched another attack on the station, led by
[Jirai Laitanen aka. Fatal](2cUo2UbsCruVr7VsIHmw1N). [Korako Kosakami](3Mb6UfjhKf0MdSbbR4a2EU) aka. The Rabbit managed
to breach and successfully kidnapped Touvolle and Umailen. As the pirate
forces retreated with the scientists, Fatal's ship was destroyed and he
was podded.

With Fatal incapacitated, the Guristas quickly began trying to get rid
of the scientists, subsequently selling them [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV). Following this, they withdrew
completely from Crielere, leaving the station a ruined husk.

Hunt for the scientists
-----------------------

The sale of the scientists to Kor-Azor caused much outrage, with
President Foiritan himself entering negotiations
for their return. He eventually convinced Aritcio to release them in
exchange for trade and mining rights in the Federation.

However, it was revealed that the two men freed were not the scientists,
but rather [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) slaves
who had managed to steal their identities. The slaves had been destined
for sulfur mines on Inis-Ilix I. Rescue teams were dispatched to the
planet to look for them as Aritcio demanded the return of the slaves.
The Federation refused, claiming the slaves had been rightfully
purchased, and freed them.

Touvolle and Umailen were eventually found starved to death on Inis-Ilix
I. The [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) then claimed the escaped slaves were
actually rebel infiltrators who had made off with numerous secret Amarr
documents.

The deaths of the scientists officially brought a close to the Crielere
project.
