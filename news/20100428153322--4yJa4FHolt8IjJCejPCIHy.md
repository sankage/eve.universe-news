New Caldari **-** Dr. Tamo Kintonnen, research scientist for Hyasyoda, has been released by Provist investigators after a week of what has been described as "intensive interviews."

The Press Office of Hyasyoda released the following statement about the scientist's detainment:

"We have made a formal complaint to the CPD over this matter. Hyasyoda employees and their professional intellectual property belong to the Corporation. It is against the founding principles of the State for an outside agency to interfere with individual corporations' employees, and we question the legality of this inquiry."

The Caldari Providence Directorate refused to comment on the ongoing Crielere inquiry.
