# Sacred Flesh
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/sacred-flesh

Sacred Flesh is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) religious belief that
[royal flesh](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) is sacred. It is an important
doctrine of [the Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp).

Cloning restriction
-------------------

The most notable consequence of the doctrine is the restriction against
the cloning of any member of a royal family; this includes the five
Amarr Heirs and the [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ). Royal
flesh is considered sacred to the Amarr and thus
[cloning](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o) a whole body is believed to make the
sacred flesh impure. Because of this, the deaths of the heirs following
the [Amarr Succession](1wt48mKlJG23uoZhpmxNzx) are permanent.

Known violations of the restriction
-----------------------------------

Despite the importance of the doctrine, it has been violated more than
once. [Keral](7bRDME40tMpJRpS2MtG1NC), a member of the
[Ardishapur](l4Pyl3Ih1qyPmOugFKhHO) family, was cloned by his
mother [Bethora](5wsvjWAtEn3fgbxYCq7eG3) after his death in a racing
accident. In addition, [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) was cloned
after her participation in the trials and later returned to become
Empress. Though there was initial controversy surrounding her return, it
died down in the months following her election as Empress, and it is now
publicly claimed that her return was due to divine intervention.

Exemptions for partial regrowth of flesh
----------------------------------------

Significantly, it is only a full clone that is considered impure.
Regrowing flesh from a living portion of the original is not considered
a violation of the doctrine, as evidenced by the treatment of [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV) at the hands of the [Speaker of Truths](3vA8Xh4A10DiybH2UTOEUO) [Brother Joshua](3GdUiafeRMQKdpzDb8CWnJ). Aritcio was brought to the brink of
death, then revived and healed using a [cellular regenerator](4liwftCjzbWBQHTNJb5OXJ). Though his individual
cells were cloned, the whole was still considered pure.
