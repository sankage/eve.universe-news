# Torsad-Laur
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/torsad-laur

The **Torsad-Laur** district of [Dam-Torsad](UI6KVmdCZ0H42EvHijFVZ)
features a mud-brick terminal surrounded by pray-drones, beggars, and
narrow cobblestone streets. It is said to be the only slave-inhabited
quarter where the gentry can walk at night without being attacked and
where one could even have a conversation with a slave. The district is
nicknamed 'The Cauldron' for its mix of smells from the merchant stalls
in Izoni Square. The merchants here sell hand-made cutlery, bootleg
[holosymphs](3wMNl4r8nlqV8iK1tAdSWc), off-world condiments of varying
legality, [scriptual terp mods](6TIpQ8lAsM2isnRlh4xHqZ), [Adakul manuals](1nYy5VaKr9UPOwT8IRjxNY), designer-knock-off
[Caille](73TXaac6RTgSJaqJHkTxCz) leathers, and virtually every creature of
[New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) prepared for consumption.
