Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/achilles-missile

The **Achilles Missile** was a weapons system developed by [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) scientist and engineer [Tyma Raitaru](7ob8hxj1dDs8rWw7u6tNRt).
In the design of Achilles, Raitaru combined the innovative approach of the researcher with the practical
mindset of the craftsman. The Achilles missile didn't employ any revolutionary new technology, but instead it combined many solid concepts and designs to make it extremely reliable and powerful for a
small price. Forty years ago, Raitaru offered the blueprints for sale on the open market. The Achilles missile was at that time the best missile available and every empire and every faction wanted it.
