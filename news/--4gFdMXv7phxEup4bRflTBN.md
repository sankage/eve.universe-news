The **Garden of Contemplation** is a location near the Imperial Court on [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4) that members of the court can visit. It is an open air garden that has benches and at least one bronze statue of a [slaver](4nmSv26geCZDYdQ8E5cVh9). It is a common place of respite for members of the court. [Antar](1Hsjz0jFxyOlxJm9FhkcLv) visited it once with [Lerenge](m11v3cLgKxFds7KnprkyN).
