# Archaea
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/archaea

Archaea are single-celled organisms found in all manners of habitats.

One notable example was found inside an asteroid that landed near [Outpost 4972](7lJLYLN8srQsuRHZJsCfVR). The archaea lived in sealed pockets inside the asteroid and interacted in unusual ways with the metals inside. Information on the archaea was apparently valuable, as [Szekel](2KLlyAO4njOMOllcdmqgtv) stole it, causing the launch of an intense investigation.
