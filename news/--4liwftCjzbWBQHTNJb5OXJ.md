# Cellular Regenerator
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/cellular-regenerator

Medical **cellular regenerators** are devices that speed human healing processes. They apparently functionally similar to
[cloning](5y5CUyA9h4xXY40dInhn3o), but do not clone an entire organism, only working on individual cells.

A cellular regenerator was used to keep [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV) alive during his allotted
punishment by the [Speakers of Truth](3vA8Xh4A10DiybH2UTOEUO),
when his flesh and parts of his body were surgically removed time and
again.
