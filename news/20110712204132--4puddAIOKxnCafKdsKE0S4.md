At 20:00 in New Eden, a fleet of over 40 capsuleers warped to the hostile vessels and engaged the Sansha forces.   
  
More than 100 capsuleers and rising from across New Eden are forming up in fleets in an attempt to destroy the hostile Sansha forces. Slave Ation09 mocked the capsuleers as they arrived in the system: “It's going to take more than a fleet of half a dozen pods to challenge me.”
