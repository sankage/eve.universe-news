 **â€‹ Jita, The Forge** \- Protests are taking place following the recent words spoken by The Mittani, the re-elected CSM Chair.   
  
He was recently quoted saying: "Incidentally if you want to make the guy kill himself his name is [Removed]... He has his own corp... find him."[![Jita Protests Reignite](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4949/id4949-1thumb.png)](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http://www.eve-ic.net/media/articles/4949/id4949-1.png)   
  
Speaking to the capsuleer, however, he finds these comments and the aggression "unprovoked".   
  
A number of capsuleers have called for the resignation of The Mittani. While he has many supporters, there seems to be those who feel that as a community figure he should be held to a higher standard and should not publicly call for the killing of another capsuleer.
