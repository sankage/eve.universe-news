The second day of qualifying has begun for the Eighth Alliance Tournament. Three flagships have been fielded so far with one lost, will more be fielded this round? The Brutix is the highest fielded ship with seven so far and 100% survival. The Drake remains the top ship fielded so far in this tournament with 34 fielded last week.
