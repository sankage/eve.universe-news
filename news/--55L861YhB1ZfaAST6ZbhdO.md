## Guristas Pirates

Founded by the charismatic [Fatal](2cUo2UbsCruVr7VsIHmw1N) and technically-minded [Rabbit](3Mb6UfjhKf0MdSbbR4a2EU), the **Guristas** pirates are a fearless, professional and highly-organized outfit operating out of their home region of Venal. Unlike other rogue factions, their activities are based not around any twisted ideology or creed, but rather a good old-fashioned lust for wealth and power. 

The Guristas focus primarily on interstellar piracy in the outer regions and low-security space. The Guristas maintain hundreds of deadspace listening posts and staging points on the Caldari border, and are known for being unafraid to stage strikes deep within the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy).

Typically their business revolves around black-market trading, including human trafficking, illegal weapons manufacture, and smuggling of illicit goods. In addition to this, the Guristas control a large share of the gray market within the Caldari State, smuggling unregulated products into megacorporation enclaves within state borders.

Possibly the most lucrative of their operations, however, are their counterfeiting circles. Unafraid to knock off anything from designer goods to hard currency, the Guristas will bluff any market that can cut them a clean and sizable profit. Just one example is their illegal currency exchange of Caldari corporate scrip, the largest network of its type in New Eden.
