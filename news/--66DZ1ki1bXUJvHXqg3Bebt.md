# Caldari Bloodlines
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/caldari-bloodlines

The **Caldari bloodlines** refer to the two distinct races that emerged
on [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i), the [Deteis](7vixEvaBXQYC2ywT3fyAwd) and [Civire](1lEM3yHeoK1HEpa1FrLwH5).

Back in the days when the the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) occupied
Caldari Prime, each bloodline developed on a separate continent and was
very distinct both physically and culturally. At the start of the war
with the [Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) the Caldari race was uprooted
as a whole and thrown into a melting pot where fighting for their
survival was all that mattered. The frantic decades that followed
altered the Caldari psyche forever. Discipline and loyalty came to the
forefront and still shapes Caldari society into something new. Currently
people in the State identify themselves as Caldari first, their
corporation second, and their bloodline a distant third. None of the
megacorps are structured around
bloodlines and they intermingle freely on every level. Even so,
intermarriages are rare, but this is thought to be more a matter of
physical preference. Although the individual bloodlines are proud of
their heritage, it ranks low in importance.
