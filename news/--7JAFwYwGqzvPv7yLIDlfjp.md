# Elder Fleet
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/elder-fleet

The **Elder Fleet** was a combined
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp)-Thukker
invasion force that assaulted the [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) and
[Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) systems in YC110. The fleet was composed
of at least three sub-fleets; each fleet included a Ragnarok-class
[Titan](XH5ZPvSBGGIStAEWqWHOl), several smaller capital ships, and numerous
sub-capital wings.

The fleet was constructed in secrecy under the direction of the Minmatar
Elders and the Thukker Tribe in the Great Wildlands, using
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) aide money siphoned from public works
projects. The fleet was decimated by [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) in the Battle of Mekhios and the Elders'
subsequent retreat.
