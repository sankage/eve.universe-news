LUMINAIRE - SCOPE News has obtained link feeds of the rescue operation on Seyllin I, in which President Foiritan implores the people of Metal City and Loadcore to "not wait where you are to be rescued" and to "use the magrail system to move yourself to safety." Both cities were on the day side of the planet when the solar radiological pulse struck, and neither is approachable by dropship.   
  
According to Federation Navy officials, the rescue effort is "going as well as can be expected" given the constraint of having limited landing sites. An estimated quarter-million people have been evacuated thus far.  
  
Federation census officials have stated that the total population of Seyllin I is estimated to be over half a billion people.
