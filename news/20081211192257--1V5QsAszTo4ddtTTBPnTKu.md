Kihtaled - A Caldari trade mission consisting of executives and diplomats from all eight major megacorporations arrived in the Khanid Kingdom today. To the surprise of many here, the trade mission was led by Haatakan Oiritsuu, dethroned former CEO of the Kaalakiota Corporation, who has been in seclusion since the end of May.

The Caldari delegation is tasked with negotiating a number of new trade deals with the Khanid Kingdom, including supply contracts for the Navy and Khanid Innovations. However, they have also taken the time to speak with representatives from the Tash-Murkon Family, who are in Khanid space for similar reasons. Relations between the Tash-Murkon and the Caldari have always been somewhat closer than those of the Caldari and the other royal families, due to the Tash-Murkons' mercantile focus, but this is the first time in recent memory where such high-level meetings between the two have been held.

According to corporate insiders, it was Tibus Heth who chose Oiritsuu to head the mission, despite apprehension from the board. Some in the Caldari Provincial Directorate, speaking under the condition of anonymity, have expressed concern with the choice, saying among other things that Heth's relationship with the "old guard" of the Caldari corporate system has never been more unclear than now.

The Caldari delegation is expected to spend the next week touring the Khanid core systems and meeting with various Khanid corporations and government bodies; they will then make a short stop in Kaaputenen to meet with officials from the Caldari Business Tribunal's customs authority before returning to New Caldari.
