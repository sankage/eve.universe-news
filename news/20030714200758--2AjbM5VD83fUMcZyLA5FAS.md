Operators of the docking facilities at Mora VI - Moon 4 - Ishukone Corporation Factory and Gehi IX - Moon 4 Royal Khanid Navy Assembly Plant have gone on strike to underline their wishes for a better dental plan and longer holidays. The stand-in operators, just out of school, are having some trouble in their duties resulting in ships being unable to undock. Travellers are advised not to dock at Gehi or Mora if they can avoid it until the issue has been resolved.
