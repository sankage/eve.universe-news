 **Molea, Khanid** \- During the past several months, the landmark cemetery created by Azia Burgi has recovered from previous violence and is now larger than ever.

It has taken twenty-two months for Azia Burgi to rebuild her cemetery and to surpass its former size.  
  
According to Taak Coram, a capsuleer who regularly flies from Placid to donate corpses to the cemetery, the site keeps growing and is now noticeably bigger than it had been in the past. Taak believes that the cemetery is a grand attraction for a backwater system like Molea.
