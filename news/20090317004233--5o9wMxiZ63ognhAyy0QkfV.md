**PR-8CA, Delve** -  On the 13th of this month, the first sign of a possible renewal of active hostilities in Delve came when KenZoku and their allies managed to gain control of PR-8CA for long enough to evacuate multiple capital assets.

Over the last few weeks, GoonSwarm have attained [sovereignty over all of Delve](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdl.eve-files.com%2Fmedia%2Fcorp%2Fverite%2F20090316.png), Skunk-Works lost their sovereignty in Querious, with [RAZOR Alliance ceding two territorial enclaves](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdl.eve-files.com%2Fmedia%2Fcorp%2Fverite%2F20090311.png) to their GoonSwarm allies. A [month-long camp](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eveonline.com%2Fingameboard.asp%3Fa%3Dtopic%26threadID%3D1023456) of PR-8CA was initiated to contain KenZoku's capital assets, which had been cached in the system.

[Xeliya stated](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Ft%3D24438) at the time: "We ([KenZoku, Against ALL Authorities and allies]) have been controlling PR-8CA for the last 3+ hours. Numbers are even but no major fights. Local is holding mid 900's with about 100 hostiles few jumps out hanging out... A ton of assets - [capitals, motherships] and titans have been jumped out."

Shadoo of Pandemic Legion fought the GKC forces at a [Pandemic Legion control tower in system](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Ft%3D24438%26postdays%3D0%26postorder%3Dasc%26start%3D15):

"As Tau Ceti Federation jump-bridged in [to our tower], they were able to retreat inside shield with no losses taken. In fact, the A/ROL/SE fleet did not warp in until pretty much the last Tau Ceti Federation battleship had made it inside the shields. However, we could not resist such a chance to enjoy some pew-pew and quickly bubbles were called on the A/ROL fleet with [our tower's] guns [primarying] and Tau Ceti Federation's battleships and Pandemic Legions HACs dipping in and out of shields to take potshots.   
  
"We were pretty outnumbered in terms of battleships even against just A/ROL... and as such about an equal number of battleships were lost on that engagement with support dying as well. The A/ROL fleet appeared to have a pretty good buffer tank with multiple logistics ships and drones to soak out the [incoming fire] from the tower. I can only assume that [system overloads were] affecting their logistics pretty heavily as we still managed to chew through a few battleships with the control tower's guns.   
  
"I had to leave at this point... but it appears most of the hostiles came back to [the tower] for some reason afterwards though this time keeping range from the warp disruptors. Not sure why they were shooting the Pandemic Legion tower; probably to entice another round of fights. The tower was not reinforced, though a number of guns were incapacitated... I presume they took potshots in hopes of a fight. With local about 900 at this point though, it didn't seem likely.   
  
"During all of this, [KenZoku reportedly evacuated] around 60 [dreadnoughts, 4 motherships] and 2 titans out of PR-8CA with multiple [jump freighters] and a good amount of carriers as well. [A prize] goes to [Waagaa Ktlehr] for the most dreads moved according to count; ouch on the cloning cost I'd say but fair play for the efforts. [Executive Outcomes] had joined in as well with a support fleet and capitals evacuating."

Tyrrax Thork, who had an agent in the affray, [disputed Xeliya's perception of the numbers](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Ft%3D24438%26postdays%3D0%26postorder%3Dasc%26start%3D15): "[It] looked more like 2 to 1 numbers to me (in favor of the [Against ALL Authorities] side, which [my agent] may or may not have been on).  
  
"[There were] not many engagements until Stainwagon/-A- was leaving, then I think Goons caught one of the groups and did some damage, then made up for it by jumping outnumbered into a "camp" and getting massacred (support was all on gate waiting with bs farther out and aligned)."

StainWagon is the collective name given to the coalition of C0VEN, Stain Empire and Systematic-Chaos, who are allied with Against ALL Authorities and RED.Overlord in their efforts to conquer GoonSwarm's former space in Esoteria and Feythabolis.

"From what I can gather it appears there was a "somewhat" of a "welp" moment with the pursuing GF/TCF fleet . From what I heard, in D-3 the fleet scout had reported A/SE/ROL/EXE/ETC BSes warping OFF the gate with support remaining behind. Thus TCF/GF jumped in with about 200-220 with local going up to reported 600 or so.   
  
"What turned out to be the case was that A/SE/ROL/EXE/etc fleet had warped to _sniping_ positions on the incoming gate, and well... Shall we say "squish?" Pandemic Legion was unfortunately 2 jumps ahead so we missed out on all the action apart from some Atlas Alliance HACs who didn't seem to know we were there."

Perhaps the most [interesting question was rasied by Atius Tirawa](http://www.eve-ic.net/media/igbd/igbd.php?faction=ic&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scrapheap-challenge.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Ft%3D24438%26postdays%3D0%26postorder%3Dasc%26start%3D15) of Destructive Influence:

"Now we will see if people jump ship because they have their capitals back or they will stay and use the capital ships in space."
