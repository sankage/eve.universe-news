# FTL Communications Networks
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/ftl-communications-networks

**FTL communications networks** are composed of numerous quantum-entangled
[fluid routers](4w6FgQepyWkx0g0zXZctHM). The services and routers, albeit owned and
run by independent companies, are under constant scrutiny and regulations by [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt)
to enforce both security and privacy in the communications channels and
to make sure the companies are correctly rendering the services they
claim. The fierce competition on the telecommunication market makes it
cheap, efficient and reliable to talk, transfer data, and even conduct
business to people light-years apart. The Communications Relay
Commission or Communications Relay Committee was previously in charge of
the CONCORD scrutiny and directive enforcement in the FTL telecom
business.
