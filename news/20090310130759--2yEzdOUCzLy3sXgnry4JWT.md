NEW CALDARI - In response to President Foiritan's order to pull Federation forces off the Border Zone, State Executor Tibus Heth ordered the Caldari Navy to stand down. The two nations were poised for a standoff as the crisis in Seyllin unfolded, but tensions eased following confirmation from scientists that the system's local sun was responsible for the radiological pulse, and not a military strike.  
   
Though not lowering its readiness entirely, both forces appear to have resumed pre-crisis levels. A spokesman for the State Protectorate has restated Heth's offer of assistance to the victims of Seyllin.
