# Amarr Empire
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/amarr

## Overview
The **Amarr Empire**, a theocratic monarchy, is the largest nation in [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk). It is known for its omnipresent religion and use of slave labor.

The largest of the empires in the world of EVE, the Amarr Empire spans 40% of the inhabited solar systems. Amarr is a theocracy and a ritualistic, authoritarian imperial state where the ruling figure, the [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ), holds near-absolute power. 

Below him are the five [Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh), the heads of the five royal families from which a new Emperor is traditionally chosen, along with a sixth one, the Khanid Family, only recently brought back to the fold. The Emperor's authority is unquestioned and absolute, but the archaic and bureaucratic system of government makes it difficult for him to exert his rule unless directly in person. Otherwise, the Heirs rule in his name, dividing the huge empire between them.

The Emperor and the Five Heirs can expect to live for at least 500 years. Extensive cyber-implants keep their frail bodies alive, even when their organs begin to fail. These cyber-enhancements date back many millennia, and have become a symbol of royal divinity in the eyes of the Amarrians.
