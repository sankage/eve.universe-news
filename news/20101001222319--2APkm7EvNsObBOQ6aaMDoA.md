A few weeks ago, Aperture Harmonics [AHARM] moved 16 capital ships into a wormhole to engage Capital Construction Research [CCRES] for control of the wormhole. The inherent instability of wormholes made this task difficult and time consuming.  
  
The mass of capital ships passing through a wormhole can collapse the opening after only one or two ships have gone through. In addition, [CCRES] was aware of the pending invasion and made every effort to prematurely collapse any opening they could scan down. Despite these difficulties, [AHARM] persisted in searching out new openings and moving capital ships in, eventually bringing 11 dreadnaughts and 5 carriers into the wormhole.  
  
Despite a slow start to the conflict, [CCRES] downed an [AHARM] carrier early on: "[They] eventually let their guard down a bit and opened some opportunities for retaliation, and we managed to destroy a carrier that was assisting a subcap blockade of our main tower." explained Thernys of [CCRES].  
  
The battle raged through the night and into the next day. With the large number of [AHARM] capital ships present and assistance from mercenary alliance Noir. Mercenary Group, Thernys decided to follow a 'scorched earth' policy; "[We] resorted to self destructing a considerable amount of assets, simply to stop them from ending up in hostile hands as spoils. [This] speaks to the volume of ships in there - we could not possibly have used them all in combat without getting pod killed, and ending up in a station leaving everything up for grabs." [AHARM] member Seamus McLove reported seeing pilots self-destructing [CCRES] assets for as long as eight hours.  
  
[CCRES] estimates that they lost at least $100 billion in assets, despite getting several tech 3 ships out of the area. [AHARM] reports losing one carrier, but no other loss information has been provided.  
  
In retrospect, [CCRES] feels no bitterness at their defeat. Says Thernys, "As for general commentary, Aharm received information on a good time to launch an attack, got their assets in place and bought up some extra muscle to make sure the job gets done - this is all well and good and in the spirit of [New Eden.] We had our own initiative against them planned and in the setup stage, but unfortunately they beat us to the punch." adding that; "The characteristics of wspace being such that external aid can be extremely hard to reach, especially if a hostile force manages to control access to the static exit."  
  
Both sides are adamant about prospering in the near future. Thernys states that "we have already re-established a wspace presence and will continue to be a relevant entity there." Two step also commented from the [AHARM] perspective: "[Our] future plans include more of this. [We] have heard from a lot of other w-space corps that the whole thing made them rethink their own defenses."
