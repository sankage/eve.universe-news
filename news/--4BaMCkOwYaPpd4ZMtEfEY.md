# Mannar
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/mannar

The **Mannar** are one of the four founding races of the
[Gallente Federation](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) alongside the
[Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn), [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy), and the
Gallente themselves. Their home system, Mannar, is located in the
[Everyshore](239UsWf0eflceZoW5SLYvE) region of the Federation. Their home
planet, Mannar VIII, is now a barren wasteland, following an unspecified
calamity.

First contact with the Gallente was made 15 years after Gallente-Intaki
first contact and today they are spread far and wide through
Federation systems.

Many modern Mannar associate with the Hawk political bloc of Federation
politics, a group that advocates nationalistic attitudes and a
militaristic approach to foreign policy.
