# Bio Nanological Sealants
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/bio-nanological-sealants

**Bio-nanological sealants** are any compound of organic and non-organic
materials that serve to form barriers or seals. In general usage, the
term 'bio-nanological sealant' usually refers to compounds of a medical
nature, also called biofoam, though technically it is a blanket term
that can be applied to any compound of this type.

Overview
--------

With recent advances in both nano-technology and bio engineering, some
fields of study have found that combining these technologies yield
better results than either can achieve separately. In some cases, such
as with biofoam, the nanobots act as temporary sealants for breaks
in the tissue walls of blood vessels, while the biological component
consists of a coating of protein receptors which make the bots invisible
to white blood cells. These protein receptors also attract red blood
cells, and form the latticework needed to repair breaches until the host
organism regenerates the cells to repair the defect natively. Other
common medical uses for these types of sealants are nano-gauze, and
Neoskin, a substance that is sprayed on hands and forms a second skin,
protecting the wearer from the effects of touching anesthetic, while
also preventing the spread of germs.

Other compounds of this type include industrial materials such as
organic mortar, used to seal large structural bulkheads.
