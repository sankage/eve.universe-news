**Blueprint invention** is a process by which an ordinary [blueprint](blueprint) is improved upon.

A lab researcher improves on a normal “Tech 1” blueprint by using design patterns found in datacores. The result is a completely different design, which may require special new materials and manufacturing processes to produce. The digital rights management involved in these processes prevent the production of unlimited 'original' blueprints.
