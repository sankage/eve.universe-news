YULAI - SCOPE News is attempting to verify reports that efforts by CONCORD scientists to investigate the radiological event possibly generated by the Seyllin sun have reached an impasse, as research probes deployed towards the Class-O star have vanished and were allegedly destroyed. The reporter who broke this story was detained by DED officials after delivering this information to the SCOPE News Bureau desk and is being held without formal charges. CONCORD officials refuse to answer questions about the incident, and will not confirm nor deny that the reporter is in their custody.
