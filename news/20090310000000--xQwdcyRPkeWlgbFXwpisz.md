YULAI - CONCORD blasted the SCOPE News corporation, calling Chief Editor Lars Kiormen's last report on the crisis in Seyllin "impetuous, inflammatory, and irresponsible." The harsh reaction follows Mr. Kiormen's report that a potentially world-shattering solar mass was heading towards the planet, plus an emotional farewell to SCOPE reporters trapped on Seyllin I. CONCORD angrily dismissed the report as a "shocking, selfish attempt to exploit sensationalism during a time when composure and calm are needed most."  
  
CONCORD adamantly denies the unlawful detention of any SCOPE personnel, "or the fictitious existence of any timers or countdowns for Seyllin."
