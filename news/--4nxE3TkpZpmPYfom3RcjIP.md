**Aleine**, a student of [Nusi](7pRoTKNNSHpKwWpq2pFy14), answered a question about why the [Khanid](1IRIdXfOZrfl5BuFuabOh6) were disallowed from the [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) chambers. She later wondered what the symbols on Nusi's board had to do with the Khanid. She has a noticeable accent that other of Nusi's students lack.
