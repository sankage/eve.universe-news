Pator - Sebiestor Tribal Chief Karin Midular today called upon the Minmatar Republic to hold an emergency session of parliament as soon as possible, stating that "while the populace remains in shock at these recent events, decisive action by the leaders of the people of Matar is long overdue". 

The other tribal chiefs were quick to respond, silencing the usual flurry of arguing parliamentarian members. The Emergency Session of Parliament is due to commence in two days time.
