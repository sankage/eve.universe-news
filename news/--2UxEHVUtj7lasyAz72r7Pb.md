# Holographic Interface
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/holographic-interface

A **holographic interface** is a computer input method that utilizes a [projected](3R2yaSdkUb08ifof3FfTZd) image instead of a physical device. Holographic interfaces are popular on computer systems that see a variety of uses, as well as those that require extremely complex inputs. Because they are more expensive than physical interfaces, they tend to be restricted to wealthy areas.

Technology
----------

Holographic interfaces utilize holoprojectors to create a 3d image in
whatever configuration is most appropriate to the program used. Because
the image is constructed only of light, the configuration can be as
simple or complex as needed, and easily scaled to a size that the user
finds comfortable. Additionally, it can be dynamically reconfigured, so
a user can quickly switch from a simplified interface to a more involved
one as need.

Interaction with the image is recorded via sensors in the projector, not
through direct manipulation of the hologram. These sensors can record
the precise location of the user's fingers (or other appendages for
interfaces that utilize them), enabling pinpoint control.

Uses
----

Holographic interfaces are popular in holovid games, as well as with
computers in government offices. Though the projector has a more
expensive up-front cost than a physical interface device, because they
can be easily reconfigured to any layout through software, and do not
require swapping and storage as with physical interfaces, they can be
less expensive in the long run.

Most pieces of software include code that creates a customized
holographic interface for those with projectors. Many are written with
holographic interfaces in mind, utilizing complicated hacks to enable
older interface methods to still work.
