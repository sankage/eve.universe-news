December
========

Roden Victorious
----------------

The [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) [Presidential](UW2GqozmvYnsm1kRPpp1E)
elections took place on the first day of December with all votes from
participating district checked and tallied by the day after the poll.
The Federal Elections Commission was able to declare [Jacus Roden](1ijjvREo0tNCQD1EKlUa5z) the outright winner as he had secured a
majority of 58.7% of all votes cast. This convincing majority followed a
broad-based campaign including pledges to root out corruption in
government, improve strained relations with the [Minmatar Republic](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp), reform the [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1), and include
[capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) more closely in the war effort. His
most prominent, and perhaps controversial, campaign pledge had been his
promise to recover [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i). While the
means by which this would be achieved was an open question, the pledge
had played well with a Federation population considering the Luminaire
situation to be an "open wound." His comfortable majority also indicated
that playing to concerns over corruption and military leadership had
been a successful strategy.

Roden's closest challenger for the presidency was Governor Celes Aguard,
polling 31.2% of the vote, and she graciously conceded defeat in a
personal transmission to Jacus Roden, pledging her support for "all
policies of the Presidency that uphold the interests of the entire
Federation." This last was probably a coded reference to the frontier
worlds occupied by the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) and denied
the vote - a factor that may well have cost her many votes. Senator
Vilard Garioss, polling only 8.8% of the vote, chose to concede in a
brief public statement. It was announced that President-elect Roden
would assume office at his inauguration before the Gallente
[Senate](x8brOPuT22Bcly2Sikkt5) in the New Year.

Reactions to the Election
-------------------------

Reactions to the election of Jacus Roden from across [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk) were broadly positive, if naturally
wary in the case of the Caldari State. State Executor [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG) emphasized that 'any attempt to intrude
upon the sovereign territory of the Caldari State will be met with an
immediate and overwhelming response.' This was seen as a warning that
Roden's campaign promises regarding recovery of Caldari Prime and the
occupied Gallente systems. Certainly, Heth's use of the term 'sovereign
territory' indicated very clearly the Caldari attitude to both Caldari
Prime and the territories they had gained in the [State Protectorate](2VlyV0CDyxFv0Qg3N3dW8k) offensive.

The Minmatar Republic greeted the election result with optimism and
[Sanmatar](180IYq6xQy0PzfGH6hLEuO) [Maleatu Shakor](3H5EVyO9kiyIUOEELIqOlV) stated that he looked forward to a
"productive relationship" with President-elect Roden. A little more
surprisingly, the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) chose to formally
congratulate Jacus Roden, while at the same time making a blistering
attack on the policies of the outgoing President Foiritan. Experienced
observers of Amarr diplomacy interpreted the Amarr statement as a
remarkably positive welcome for the new president.

Corporate Warfare
-----------------

In the Caldari State, [Sukuuvestaa Corporation](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB) admitted that many of
its facilities in the Essence and Verge Vendor regions had been
attacked. The megacorp blamed 'Gallente terrorists' and announcied an
increase in defense spending but a deadly explosion at a [Lai Dai Corporation](5k5GiWRlFceyTjLSz71XT) ammunition factory in Nourvukaiken
followed within days. The [Caldari Business Tribunal](32Y4no5DBn6kGO5HnWuYgH) launched an inquiry into
the attacks on Sukuuvestaa assets and soon also took in the assaults
that Lai Dai had been suffering. As yet another attack took place, this
time a cybernetic assault on a Caldari scientist working for Lai Dai,
the involvement of the CBT in matters suggested an internal Caldari
State problem rather than Gallente terrorism. Sure enough, the CBT
called representatives of both the Lai Dai and Sukuuvestaa corporations
to a closed hearing and ultimately censured the two megacorporation for
use of 'unlawful anti-competitive measures' ? evidently campaigns of
espionage and sabotage carried out by both corporations on each other's
holdings.

Caldari Misfortunes
-------------------

The misfortunes of the Caldari corporations were not limited to
internecine warfare by any means, and the [Wiyrkomi Corporation](66psXtrftjRzA7MyKHtb7K) fell prey to an upsurge of
[Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) activity in the Okunsa constellation
when two of their freighters were attacked by the pirate group in the
Mara system. The Lai Dai made off with an estimated 12bn ISK in
electronic components while leaving behind them two gutted and useless
wrecks.

Perhaps more seriously, a severe accident at a [CBD Corporation](7o6AuVZhnq4lIzIMdYdMft) asteroid mine in Annaro killed
over 30 miners and trapped 200 more. With echoes of the earlier Kaunokka
incident, the incident seemed to reveal that CBD had not put its house
in order after all. CBD subsidiary [Deep Core Mining Inc.](1H5H7H31pmuSXDnw1k6mvM) had the specialized rescue
teams that would be required to free the trapped miners at its disposal
but expressed deep reluctance to commit a team to the effort. An unusual
development was an offer by Amarr mining corporation [Ducia Foundry](6sCdhoug6FOa0zTTypjzvd) to send a rescue team including a
number of slaves. As this would be against Caldari anti-slavery laws it
appeared very unlikely that the offer would be taken up.

With the trapped Annaro miners estimated to have a little less than six
days of breathable air by the last day of the month, the [year YC111](1nWwkV0QgotpxAOb5HQ6CA), already replete with tragedy seemed to be
closing on a suitably grim note.
