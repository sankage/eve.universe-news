# Mordu's Legion
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/mordus-legion

Mordu's Legion is a [minor faction](minor-factions) in
[New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk). It was formed by military
mastermind [Muryia Mordu](1V7T2MMuQi8OZQi7QQlTpV) after the Waschi
Uprising, when he took many of his disenfranchised, former
[Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn) troops - who had been persecuted on [Kamokor IV](yOVXgfGWF8UUaMX1vPAlK)
by nationalists - under his wing. Their first
action involved putting down the same uprising. They performed this task
quickly and efficiently, establishing a trustworthy reputation that has
remained to this very day.

Initial Founding
----------------

Towards the end of the first [Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV)
many [Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn),
who sympathized with the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) side of the
fight, were exiled from the [Gallente Federation](Gallente-Federation).
They, alongside others who
defected, approached the Caldari and stated their willingness to take up
arms against the Federation. Many of these men and women were trained
soldiers and brought a wealth of expertise with them that the Caldari
military forces were keen to exploit. So as not to cause a loss of
cohesion among their existing units, aware of potential cultural
differences between Caldari and Intaki, they elected to form a single
unit with the defectors rather than spreading them out among existing
branches of the Caldari military. They placed this unit under the
command of Brigadier General [Muryia Mordu](1V7T2MMuQi8OZQi7QQlTpV),
known for his tactical acumen. By the end of the war the achievements of
the unit, still mostly made up of Intaki troops, were hailed as nothing
short of modern military legend. 

Following the end of the war, which had lasted almost a century, the
Intaki were invited to stay in Caldari society and granted accommodation
in Waschi City on [Kamokor IV](yOVXgfGWF8UUaMX1vPAlK). Over the years
that followed a nationalist movement took root on the planet, centered
on this city specifically due to the proportionally large presence of
the Intaki residents. Many were the subject of victimization and
xenophobic attacks, incidents that began to go unchecked by local
authorities as well. Eventually a full-blown uprising against the
Caldari government began when Caldari authorities attempted to bring the
city to order, having descended into almost daily violence.

During this uprising the Intaki who served in the war sought the help of
their former commanding officer. Muryia Mordu responded, having recently
retired from the navy, and took steps to reform his old fighting force.
However, this was complicated by the fact that none of them were
officially serving in the military anymore, placing them in a difficult
situation in terms of fighting back against the uprising. Mordu formed
the fighting force under a mercenary banner, calling themselves Mordu's
Legion and assisted the Caldari in dismantling the uprising, which they
did with calculated efficiency under Mordu's leadership.

Following the Waschi uprising, the [Caldari Navy](caldari-navy)
offered Mordu's Legion an official
station within the navy itself. Mordu turned down this offer, and
maintained his leadership over his new mercenary force which operates to
this day in New Eden as one of the most venerated and effective
freelance military contractors.

### Caldari Ties

The Legion retains close ties with the [Caldari State](Caldari-State),
and its leadership remains Caldari,
though members of all races are welcomed in its ranks, so long as they
are not known enemies of the State. The State allows the Legion access
to high-end Caldari military gear, and long-serving members of the
Legion who are not State citizens are commonly offered Caldari
citizenship upon retirement.

The Legion has set up home in [Pure Blind](Pure-Blind-Region)
and now operates as a
professional mercenary outfit. While the loss of their long-standing
contract with [ORE](ore) during the latter's recent hostile
takeover by the [Serpentis](Serpentis) was a blow, Mordu's
Legion is still very much a force to be reckoned with. It is a notable
feature of their professionalism that the Legion does not perform
training tasks itself, expecting new recruits to have prior combat
experience.

Mordu's Legion in the Empyrean Age
----------------------------------

Since the dawn of what is widely referred to as [The Empyrean Age](1F44OHn6oM10NfmzPlrSrr), when
[capsule](Capsule-lore) technology became available for
private individuals spawning a large surge of capsuleer pilots across
New Eden, Mordu's Legion has both endured the assaults of the
[capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) and secured stronger ties with major
empires. They have changed the face of their activities with the Caldari
State and Gallente Federation, acting as peacekeepers both in the
[Intaki system](17xNygfKnuI4d0t0JHAU0Z) as well as on [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i).

The Legion has also gained several new technological advances over
recent years, resulting from their new-found partnerships and giving
birth to several new ships in their arsenal.

### Legion Under Fire

Despite the good standings with the Caldari State, other empires
continually find themselves and their operations at odds with Mordu's
Legion activities. Being a mercenary organization at their core has not
made the Legion many friends. Even within the Caldari State itself their
activities are not exclusively beneficial to the State, and the Legion
are contracted by minor criminal entities regularly to run interference
and protection operations. Frequently, empire agents will contract
counter-operations targeted at not only the employers of the Legion, but
also Mordu's Legion itself.

With the rise of capsule technology spreading beyond the privilege of
the empires, many agents began to utilize the skills and capabilities of
capsuleer pilots to disrupt Legion activities. As Mordu's Legion itself
lacks any major capsuleer capability at this point, they often come out
of such conflicts on the losing end, although their recent entries into
the capsuleer-level spaceship race may indicate greater emphasis on
luring capsuleers to their cause.

Further to this complication, [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) has many
blanket-issued bounties on different threat classifications of Mordu's
Legion ships for capsuleer pilots to claim at will. As such they have
chosen to maintain a smaller static presence in New Eden compared to
other outlaw entities and pirate organizations. Instead their bases are
temporary, secreted away in dead space pockets, and their command and
organizational structure is broken down into regional cells responsible
for their own local agendas.

### ORE and Serpentis

In YC 106 Orion Mashel, the reclusive CEO of [Outer Ring Excavations](ore),
was reported to have had a personal and
heated meeting with Muryia Mordu. The meeting attracted media attention
given Mashel's recluse nature and being known for not accepting visitors
at his headquarters . 

Several days later, Mordu's Legion was seen mobilizing on a large scale,
reportedly under the direct command of Muryia Mordu himself. The
taskforce then penetrated deep into [Serpentis Corporation](serpentis-corporation)
space, avoiding all
conflict with Serpentis forces as they orbited an installation in the
heart of Serpentis territory and utilized an unknown device directed
against a chemical storage facility. They then promptly left, no
evident damage resulting, and were pursued by [Guardian Angel](guardian-angels)
forces responding to the incursion.
Several Legion ships were reported destroyed in running skirmishes
though Mordu himself and the bulk of his fleet returned to headquarters
unharmed. 

In an emergency meeting that followed, Mordu organized large scale
defensive pickets around ORE facilities to safeguard against further
retaliation by Serpentis and their [Angel Cartel](3p6aB4GMbVdMUEVYOb3kF0)
backed security forces. Many other
Legion forces were left marauding in the [Fountain](Fountain)
region, proving to be a thorn in the side of the Serpentis. A week later
the Serpentis and Cartel forces began a campaign to push the Legion
forces out of Fountain, which eventually succeeded as Mordu yielded the
field.

This clandestine campaign prosecuted by the Legion unsettled many
factions including several prominent capsuleer alliances, all of whom
publicly demanded answers from the Legion. However, none were
forthcoming.

Following this, tensions clearly rose between the Legion and ORE,
leading to the opinion that the incursion into Serpentis space was
against the wishes of Mashel, or that Mordu himself opposed the campaign
and was pressured by ORE. Either way this campaign left a sour note in
the relations between the two corporations. Mordu's Legion eventually
lost their contract with ORE as the Serpentis took a different approach
to the conflict and announced their buyout of large portions of ORE
shares. This put the Serpentis Corporation in a position of control
over ORE policy, likely contributing to ORE's decision to revoke the
Mordu's Legion contract for protection. In exchange this buyout secured
ORE assets against further interference from Serpentis activities as
well as their allies among the Angel Cartel.

### Intaki Prime and Ishukone

During the long-standing Caldari occupation of the Gallente systems,
designated as a contested zone under the [CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act](39y03QDhd4N8GXwoV2zSha), in YC
111 the [Caldari Providence Directorate](Caldari-Providence-Directorate) held a blind
auction for the administration and development rights to the systems
under their control. Intaki was the
only system awarded to the [Ishukone Corporation](ishukone-corporation). In a deal with the
Mordu's Legion and the Intaki Assembly, both corporations moved in to
provide security and commercial shipping services to the planet's
governing authority.

This was revealed to be a mutual business deal between Ishukone, the
Legion and the Intaki Assembly, who retained rights under Gallente laws
to franchise both services as they saw fit. Traditionally security
was franchised to the [Federation Navy](federation-navy) and
commercial shipping to [FedMart](fedmart).

Ishukone commercial ships, backed by Mordu's Legion military forces
arrived in orbit over the planet in March YC 112. Despite the auction
results having been announced the previous year, until this point no
movement had transpired on Ishukone's part. Furthermore, the system
control had been retaken by the [Federal Defense Union](Federal-Defence-Union) militia a week previous. The
FDU were spurred to action over the reports and large conflicts took
place over the contested planet. This was followed by a plea from the
Intaki Assembly for a cease fire, directed at the FDU, as they declared
both corporations to be "present in Intaki at the specific and
un-coerced request of the Assembly,". Later that day the
Federation Navy attempted to reassert control over the system by sending
a fleet under the control of Admiral Gouenette. The fleet was refused
entry at the Intaki stargate in [Agoze](Agoze-System), and
the Intaki System Command informed the admiral they were "neither
required nor welcomed."

While Ishukone are prohibited from sending any armed military ships to
operate in Intaki, the Mordu's Legion are given full authority to police
the local space and were given full military access. This is entirely
subject to civilian oversight by the Intaki Assembly.

Economic and political analysts across New Eden have speculated on the
specifics of the deal between the three entities, mainly centered on
Ishukone and their financial capability or willingness to have hired the
Legion forces as a system-wide security force. It was well known that
the Ishukone corporation's financial situation had taken a noticeable
decline under the rule of [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG) and the
now dissolved Caldari Providence Directorate, still in power during
these events. It is possible that much of the potential expenditure was
covered by the securing of shipping and development franchise rights
with the Assembly itself, though much was left unanswered. There has
also been wild speculation that the [Intaki Syndicate](4ODncOn9Yvcol1oPLyHrFk) and the Mordu's Legion may have
come to a back room understanding allowing the Legion to make further
inroads with security prospects with the organization.

### Caldari Prime Peacekeeping

Following the events of Operation Highlander, a concerted effort by the
Gallente Federation to retake [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i)
from the Caldari State, the planet was declared
a demilitarized zone in a treaty by both sides. Following the
destruction on the planet during the conflict, caused mostly by the
remains of the Leviathan class *Shiigeru* titan crashing to the surface,
 the administration of the planet was divided into two
districts, Gallente and Caldari controlled. Soon afterwards, the Mordu's
Legion announced their appointment as planetary security. 

This deal was, again, brokered by the Ishukone corporation who stepped
in to negotiate the terms of the ceasefire and the Caldari Prime Treaty
that followed. Having an already established relationship with the
Legion due to their mutual role in the Intaki system, the Legion was
seen by both sides of the conflict to be an ideal and already proven
neutral solution to the question of security for the planet.

Mordu's Legion remains currently in complete control of the planet's
security coordination and have worked closely with the Ishukone
corporation in the Caldari district, and [Material Acquisition](material-acquisition) in the Gallente district.
The Legion also provides regular reports to the Caldari [Chief Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr) and the Gallente
[Senate](senate) for the sake of transparency.

Since their appointment as security the Legion has received praise from
both administrations for their handling of the civilian populous. While
complaints against the Legion have been made for some instances of
heavy-handedness, overall no major incidents have arisen. Documented
cases of the Legion successfully calming or neutralizing outbreaks of
violence state they have been both effective, and even-handed in their
duties.

Research and Development Activities
-----------------------------------

In YC 116 the Mordu's Legion reportedly fielded new ship designs in what
seemed like shakedown cruises around their home region, as well as their
operations in the Intaki system. Shipping reports in Intaki specifically
highlighted unknown silhouettes dispersed among the traditional Caldari
designed Mordu's Legion patrols engaging in interdiction activities as
well as seemingly leading the patrol fleets.

Eventually these new ships were classified under CONCORD records,
revealing three new ships to be deployed by the Legion. A frigate class,
the [Garmur](Garmur); a cruiser class, the
[Orthus](Orthus); and a battleship class, the
[Barghest](Barghest). Disclosed statistics for the ships
displayed a preference for advanced missile technology and long range
warp drive disruption, seemingly derived from both Caldari and Gallente
technology. More importantly these new ship classes are entirely
designed from the ground up to accommodate capsule command systems,
unlike their older Caldari designs which have mostly been traditional
bridge crew operated with very few capsuleer pilots among the Legion in
general.

This has re-sparked speculation surrounding the nature of the
relationship between the Mordu's Legion and their Caldari and Gallente
partners. Ishukone, not only known for their introduction of capsule
technology granted to them by the [Jove Empire](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G), have been major influences in the development of missile technology now
prevalent in most Caldari ship designs today. It was later
revealed that the Legion had acquired the use of one of Ishukone's
think-tanks, Kiiragustektaa, to help design a new ship, fitting to the
needs of the Legion in their new role in Intaki. This same think-tank
was recently credited with the development of the advanced [Target
Spectrum Breaker](Target-Spectrum-Breaker-(lore)) system.

While the Legion has not confirmed any specifics, stating it as a matter
of proprietary security, it is thought this may have been a larger part
of their deal to secure Intaki space. Ishukone have also refused to
comment on this, citing similar reasons of confidentiality.

Wilder speculation as to the origin of the Gallente technology, evident
in the systems powering the long range scrambling technology, range from
back-room deals made with Gallente corporations following their role on
Caldari Prime to the rumored ties with the Intaki Syndicate.

Military experts have stated that the emphasis on long range
interdiction technology is aimed at increasing their effectiveness as
peacekeepers and paramilitary police in the Caldari-Gallente warzone.
This may signal a wider shift towards such roles in the future.

Increased Recruitment Activity
------------------------------

The Legion didn't actually participate in the fighting, but their rapid
response and clear willingness to get involved has earned them plenty of
additional friends within the Caldari Navy and
[Megacorporation]'[Megacorporation](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy)' security forces.
Recruitment activity is at an all time high as the Legion has been
actively seen seeking new recruits among the disaffected soldiers in the
current warzones. Fuelled by the recent turmoil following the dissolving
of the Caldari Providence Directorate and Tibus Heth's regime, many
Caldari soldiers have taken to joining the Legion seeking to put their
military skills to use in a different field. Likewise, Gallente military
personnel who are seeing the Legion operate up close in their role on
Caldari Prime are known to have resigned their positions in the
Federation Navy in exchange for employment with the Legion.
