**Crofton** is a large [Brutor](5xBrtZyeYfTxWkZTO1o5zg) man with a black beard, receding hairline, and a face deeply carved with smile-wrinkles. He was once a leader and a powerful orator. After a speaking engagement in [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) space, he was captured and given to the [Hedion University](32yJYVHiayBqLEZq4ulJrd) [Dam-Torsad](UI6KVmdCZ0H42EvHijFVZ) subcampus. His expertise is "representational systems of governance and their applications in a pan-planetary setting." He is often given the electric lash for expressing heretical views.
