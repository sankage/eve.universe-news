Domain - Numerous reports from fleeing merchant vessels have reported seeing unusual activity from local Sansha raiders, commonly seen attacking targets of opportunity throughout many of the southern regions of the Empire.

Reports of Sansha raiding vessels picking amongst the shattered hulls of both Amarr and Matari hulls has prompted Amarr Navy command to dispatch a handful of Navy vessels to deter the Sansha threat, although a significant proportion of Navy assets has remained to eliminate both the Minmatar attackers and the slave uprising. 

Speculation from a variety of sources has led to the widely held belief that the bounty of freshly fallen crew members has attracted the attention of the usually incoherent and mindless drones of the once great Sanshaâ€™s fleet.
