New Caldari - Several Caldari leaders took time over the last week to express their opinions on the apparent reconciliation between King Khanid II and the Amarr throne. The overall tone of their comments was quite positive, though some voices on the CEP were cautious; insiders say that some members of the Wiyrkomi and Sukuuvestaa delegations are worried about the threat a renewed Amarr-Khanid state would pose to the interstellar balance of power.

None of the State's corporate leaders expressed those concerns publicly, however. State Executor Tibus Heth, who was celebrating the anniversary of the invasion of Caldari Prime in Piak, where his rise began, told workers that "the renewed relations between our two strongest allies will be a great benefit to the State and its citizens, both economically and politically. It is my great hope that this will only hasten Amarr's success against Gallente's Minmatar puppet state, mirroring our own great successes on the Federation front."

Ishukone CEO Mens Reppola and Lai Dai CEO Alakoni Ishanoya held a joint press conference at Ishukone headquarters in Malkalen, where the two have been meeting for several days at Reppola's request. "Both our corporations are strong partners with the Khanid Kingdom and Amarr Empire, and we believe this reconciliation will be quite profitable for our corporations and the State," said Ishanoya.

"I am always glad to see friends put aside their difficulties and try to forge a more prosperous future together," said Reppola. "While this will no doubt be of great benefit to the State, the true measure of its value will be what improvements it brings to the subjects of both the King and the Empress."
