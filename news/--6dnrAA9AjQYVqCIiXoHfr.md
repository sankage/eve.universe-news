# The Bleeding Hearts of Matar
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/the-bleeding-hearts-of-matar

The **Bleeding Hearts of Matar** are a splinter group of the [Bloody Hands](1zKTY7AnnG3F5pzlKws52w).

They were involved in an attempt to get a popular
[Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) children's religious entertainer, [Dr. Adad](1rzSTLqlstsXunsk1zG2mB), to renounce his faith live on his [holo show](6KzwIfSM44ZSJ2zYAQ7rWh). They first kidnapped his partner
[Samne](1f0aCFFod3nVVVcvDYL7cQ), and killed him when Dr. Adad refused. They
then kidnapped his daughter [Prandi](38jVUkfdQ8xoIw5akylH0R), though Dr. Adad
once again refused. It is unclear if they went through with the murder
of his daughter.
