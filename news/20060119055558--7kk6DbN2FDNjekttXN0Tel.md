Claiming to have finally acquired all the needed parts for his mind control project, Dr. Albert Vance was seen yesterday in the Saila system.   
  
Despite intense verbal opposition from members of the Caldari Navy Independent Reserve intending to detain and escort him to CAIN's HQ in Isaziwa, Dr. Vance was able to purchase yet another batch of electronic parts from local pod-pilots, claiming those were enough to finish the "second fully functioning prototype of my 'Brain Wave Control Technology'". He refused to comment when asked about a specific date.   
  
No Caldari law enforcement officials were at the scene.
