Teams continue to vary their fleet compositions looking for the ideal setup. A surprising number of teams have been using Sansha Phantasm cruisers and Nightmare battleships in their fleets, with some rather poor results as demonstrated in the ATLAS ALLIANCE vs Molotov Coalition match. Using a fleet including 7 Phantasms and a Nightmare, ATLAS was not able to make their expensive venture deliver a win.

The heavy utilization of faction cruisers, although popular in the qualifying rounds, has not always been the key to a solid win. Statistics will be posted after all data has been compiled and analyzed.

Match results will be posted [here](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=981389) as they become available.
