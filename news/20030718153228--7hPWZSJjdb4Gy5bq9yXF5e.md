The rumors regarding the research pact between the Gallente Federation and the Caldari State have now been substantiated, though the nature of the research still remains unclear. Inside sources have revealed that the two empires have earmarked a secret location somewhere in the Lolbrerie constellation to be the site of their research project. Military forces from both sides are gathering in the constellation and freighters carrying heavy loads of construction material have been ordered over there. The empires are still to make any official announcements on the matter, so until then all we can do is speculate.
