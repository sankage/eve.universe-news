### Unshrouded Warden Accelerates Deathless Innovations
Sources inside Zarzakh have confirmed that the “Shrouded Structure” is no longer shrouded. Deathless Circle researchers were able to bring the ancient Jovian remnant online and out of cloak shortly after 11:00 today. Deathless operatives have been quick to establish research teams inside what they are now calling “The Warden”.

This un-shrouding follows over a month of investigations into artifacts known as Atavum by the Circle. Atavum are ancient relics left behind by Jovian explorers. A large number were delivered by capsuleer collaborators to a research facility in Zarzakh at the Deathless' request. Though they are no longer fully functional they still exert pressure on local spacetime, providing insight into how ancient Jovian technology operates. These investigations appear to have borne fruit with their unlocking of The Warden.

Multiple sources have informed the Scope that the structure’s secrets have already aided the Deathless Circle in making advances in a number of different fields. New Deathless ships are believed to be in development. These ships are capable of fitting breacher pod launchers that include the infrastructure needed to run small virtualities. These virtualities can house a team of infomorphs who then transfer to clone bodies launched in SCARAB Breacher Pods. Dubbed “Shriker clones”, they are a specialized iteration of the Upwell Consortium's workforce clones. It has been suggested that Shriker clones were developed with the assistance of Dr. Esme Moreno. A former Chemal Tech geneticist working on Upwell workforce clones, Dr. Moreno joined the Deathless Circle following her delivery to the Fulcrum by a capsuleer agent. Little is known about the completed Shriker genome, but it is believed that they feature greatly improved biological facilities in exchange for a significantly reduced lifespan. This reduced lifespan would not impact the longevity of any occupying infomorph, only their time inside a Shriker body.

Simultaneously with The Warden’s reveal, the Society of Conscious Thought has reported observing minor shifts or “ripples” in spacetime across New Eden. These ripples quickly stabilized, but Idemi Sver, CEO of the SOCT, has expressed his concern; “The original purpose of this structure remains a mystery, but its powerful potential is evident. We cannot trust such an incredible artifact to the whims of irreverent criminals such as the Deathless Circle.”

### Upwell Outraged but Unshaken by “Parasitic” Deathless
Schematics have been leaked for a new “Mercenary Den” structure designed by the Deathless Circle to attach to Upwell’s Orbital Skyhooks. These structures vary internally and their internal spaces appear to serve many purposes; from meeting places for the Circle’s less-than-legal associates, to recreational facilities for Upwell workforce members. All dens, however, feature TEBS (Transneural Echo Burn Scanner) facilities as standard. This suggests that the Deathless is embarking on an aggressive campaign of infomorph recruitment specifically targeting Upwell workforces.

The Upwell Consortium has consistently reported high satisfaction numbers amongst workforce members. Nonetheless, Deathless Circle agents seem confident that some workers are unhappy with their situation and are looking for a way out of their contracts. Given the size of the TEBS facilities, it can be inferred that the Circle expects a large number of enthusiastic applicants. A fraction of those recruited will undoubtedly work as the Deathless' new Shriker clones, but the numbers involved imply that most will work elsewhere in the organization.

In response, the Upwell Consortium has issued a statement saying that “These parasitic Mercenary Dens are a clear violation of Upwell property. We urge any capsuleers who make use of Equinox infrastructure to terminate any attempts to anchor a den to their Orbital Skyhooks. Furthermore, workforce members are free to leave their employment at any time. Though we are sure that given time, workforce members will discover there is a place for everyone in the Upwell Dream, we freely allow workforce members to quit the program.” 

While this may be true, examining the Upwell workforce standard contract reveals that those who seek to prematurely terminate their employment contracts are liable for the cost of their Upwell cloning and consciousness transfer, as well as the new body they wish to be transferred to and a final consciousness transfer into that body. The cost of these services is high enough to be prohibitive for most workforce members and in practice many may have no choice but to serve out their contracts regardless. 

DED Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall has expressed concern that “those lured by the promise of a brighter future might prefer the prospect of a life of adventure with the Deathless over the reality of lawful labor in Upwell facilities.” He went on to express concerns over the potential impact on the cluster of a large influx of Circle members. Upwell has dismissed these concerns, and insists that the Merc Dens are “a scam designed to undermine morale. Though there is no reason for any workforce member to desire to break their contract, unique encryption protocols are in place on all workforce infomorphs that prohibit remote consciousness transfers or re-embodiment without Upwell oversight. No known decryption technology is capable of bypassing these protections.”
