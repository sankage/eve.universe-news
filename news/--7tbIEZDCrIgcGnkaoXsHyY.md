# Laser Scalpels
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/laser-scalpels

**Laser scalpels** are medical instruments that utilize coherent beams
of light to make delicate incisions. The can cut flesh and instantly
cauterize wounds. Because they also cauterize nerve endings, they are
not preferred when pain is meant to be inflicted

A set of scalpels was used on [Aritcio Kor-Azor](2puF18pxR6b7AVuy3HE9IV) so that he wouldn't expire during
his allotted, and agonizing, punishment by the [Speakers of Truth](3vA8Xh4A10DiybH2UTOEUO).
