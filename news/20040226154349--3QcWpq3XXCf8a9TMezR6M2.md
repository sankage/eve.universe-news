The Guristas have ceased all major military operations in the vicinity of the Crielere system, concluding one of the largest recorded full-scale conflicts within Empire space. Once the site of epic engagements between the pirate invaders and a volunteer defense force comprised of Empire citizens, Crielere space has been abandoned. Only the smoldering ruins of the doomed Caldari-Gallente research lab and the scattered debris of countless destroyed warships remain.   
  
There have been no clear winners in this conflict, as all sides have paid a steep price for their involvement with Crielere.
