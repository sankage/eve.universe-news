# Jirai Laitanen
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/jirai-laitanen

Jirai Laitanen, better known by his nickname **"Fatal"**, was a
member of the [Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) [37th (Octopus) Squadron](6NdtjEBsqU8oCs1sTDR5pP) and later went on to found
the notorious pirate group the [Guristas](55L861YhB1ZfaAST6ZbhdO) with
[Korako Kosakami](3Mb6UfjhKf0MdSbbR4a2EU) - "The Rabbit".

Caldari Career
--------------

Laitanen was a shrewd and gifted captain, with a glib tongue and
charismatic smile. Many expected him to reach a position of authority in
the end. But he was also vain and greedy; traits that led to his
eventual desertion. Kosakami was much more introvert than his friend
Laitanen, but he had a brilliant mind and was a technical wizard.

Formation of the Guristas
-------------------------

A decade ago, Laitanen was passed over for promotion and Kosakami was
blamed for a lethal crash landing, all within the space of one week.They
stole a couple of Condor-class frigates,
the same they still use today, and set off to a pirate-infested sector
between [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) and
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) space, deserting from the Caldari Navy
and eventually founding the Guristas - an amalgamation of two Caldari
words meaning 'naughty people' and also a slang term for 'gang'.

Kidnapping
----------

At some point in their career, Fatal and the Rabbit masterminded and
carried out a kidnapping of the Gallente Federation ambassador in the
Caldari State - [Luecin Rileau](2d24moamL2NaimjLpHTENT). This has
granted them great fame.

Apparent Demise
---------------

During an engagement with capsuleers, Fatal was podkilled. Due to an
inferior clone, he reawoke with memory loss and was later apparently
ousted from the Guristas. His current whereabouts and situation are
unknown.
