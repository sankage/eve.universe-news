### Illegal Workers Union Condemned as Protests Spread Through Caldari State

New Caldari Prime – Civil unrest in the Caldari State over new rationing has reached new heights as an illegal workers union declares plans for stoppages. According to a statement issued by workers from each of the "Big Eight" megacorporations, strikes will be held throughout the State unless their demands are met. These demands include an end to rationing, protections against forced conscription, and abandoning the employee corporate classification system. 

Signed by “The United Champions of Freedom”, invoking a reference to the Brothers of Freedom who led a violent uprising against the corporate state over 15 years ago, the statement was delivered via a statewide broadcast over hijacked channels. The reader of the statement has been identified as Sumalee Daeng, a former official of the Wiyrkomi Corporation State Union (WCSU). As Wiyrkomi's affiliate to the Caldari State Workers Union, the WCSU has been quick to disavow Daeng and the newly formed United Champions of Freedom (UCF) as “agitators who refuse to do their duty in a time of war.”

The UCF statement went on to say: “Our concerns were brought before the corporate and state unions, and fell on deaf ears. We have tried to organize protests by peaceful means, and we have been denied. Now we secure our right to protest by force. We will not be silenced, nor will we fail to defend ourselves in the face of state-sanctioned violence.” This has raised concerns that there may be a connection between the UCF and reports from several megacorporation manufacturing facilities that a number of military vessels and armaments have gone missing.

CEP Chairman Akimaka Saraki has refused to acknowledge the illegal UCF union or respond directly to their statement. Executive General Heika Torigo was more forthcoming and told the Scope: “The State will not tolerate the theft of State assets or disruption of our critical infrastructure. Any who plan to participate in such activities can expect to feel the full force of the law. Though we always aim to resolve industrial disputes peacefully, we will not be cowed or held hostage by criminal and rebels.” Corporate security forces are responding to a number of incidents being described as "criminal disturbances" and "terrorist actions" across the State.

### Federation Senate Passes Automated Industry for Democracy Act with Comfortable Majority

Villore, Essence – The Gallente Federation Senate has passed the Automated Industry for Democracy Act into law, despite ongoing protests over the United Response Act. Two-thirds of the Senate backed the bill proposed by President Celes Aguard, which loosens the legal restrictions on AI development. This includes an updated definition of Restricted AI that is no longer in conformity with all CONCORD guidelines. 

President Aguard has refused requests to comment on any differences between the new Federation legislation and CONCORD’s more stringent recommendations but was willing to say that she took the view that the Federation's previous laws had been “outdated”. The President added that, “in order to maintain a competitive advantage the Federation must not be afraid to play to its strengths. Advanced robotics has always been one of those strengths. The AID Act will free our citizens from drudgery with more efficient automation. Let machines do repetitive and taxing work, let the people use their talents to build a better future and a stronger democratic nation.”

CONCORD’s Department for Restriction on Artificial Intelligence and Life (DERAIL) has issued an official statement condemning the changes to Federation law as “reckless” and “short-sighted”. When asked if CONCORD leadership had any plans to intervene, representatives were quick to play down any threat of bringing the matter before the Inner Circle or the CONCORD Assembly but added that, “We will be watching closely and judging any future development by our own standards – not by scales asjusted to suit any single empire or nation.”
