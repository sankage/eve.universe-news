SEYLLIN 0843 - A disruption in solar weather monitoring services has forced travel delays in the Seyllin system. The satellite network known as "Cassandra" is reported to have dropped offline shortly after 0840 local time, temporarily locking out traffic attempting to enter the system.   
  
Researchers at the base monitoring facility on Seyllin I are attributing the incident to a communications glitch, and expect service to be restored shortly.
