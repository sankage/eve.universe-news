# Chesiette Prime
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/chesiette-prime

**Chesiette Prime** is a temperate planet in the Chesiette system. It is a thriving world with over a billion inhabitants.

Political status
----------------

As it lies on the border between [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) and [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) space, it is theoretically an important world, but in reality has served little function. It was once under [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) protection, but apparently this is no longer the case, or at least is no longer a deterrent to capsuleer
assault. Its administrator is [Leonalle Yvesk](5qnge8y8YaWVmIoatjJv5E).

[Capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) interest
------------------------------------------

The planet contains carbon compounds under its southern continents. Interested in exploring these, the capsuleer [Omvistus's](14Seg6wEOEpNHopnuUbUtZ) corporation deployed several mining facilities and 72 new spaceports on the planet. Despite opposition from planetside forces - the facilities were placed in populated areas -
Omvistus was able to threaten Yvesk with orbital bombardment in order to get his way.
