CONCORD has issued a travel warning to all those going through the Obe system, a popular hub and trade route. Apparently a loosely held group of terrorists and marauders have been preying on innocent traders. Without mercy, these evildoers prefer erasing all traces of their crimes by actually killing their victims. CONCORD will not stand idly by, and is now calling for re-inforcements. Until then, strong escort is recommended for lone travelers.
