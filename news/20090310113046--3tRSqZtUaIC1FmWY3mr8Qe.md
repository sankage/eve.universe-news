KOURMONEN - An Amarr Navy scout patrol attached to the main battle fleet has gone silent, according to military personnel.   
  
Recently mobilized near the Bleak Lands-Heimatar border, the battle fleet lost contact with the patrol somewhere outside of the Kourmonen system. The patrol leader is unknown, although the Scope is reporting a distress comm picked up in the region. The Amarr fleet commander has refused to comment on the situation, instead preparing his fleet for maximum alert. The fleet has also been ordered to scramble all local comms frequencies.
