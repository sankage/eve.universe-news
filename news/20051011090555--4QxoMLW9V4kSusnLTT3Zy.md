The ERE took a serious blow today, suffering the loss of a portion of their latest aid shipment at the hands of Johnny W, a Gallente pod-pilot.   
  
The humanitarian organisation have been lending a hand to the poor, underprivileged and less fortunate of the galaxy for some time now and this is the first time they've been taken advantage of in such a way.   
  
The theft took place yesterday evening, during the ERE's latest convoy run. Eleven pod pilots were recruited from the local channel in Algogille, with a final destination somewhere in the Bei system. Unfortunately, Johnny W fled with his portion of the goods, most likely to sell them to the highest bidder.   
  
Karl Newton, CEO of the ERE was shocked by the betrayal, "I find it hard to believe that a fellow Gallente could be so unscrupulous. Today, for the first time, I am ashamed of my heritage."
