Colony residents of the icy planet Yong III reported a great battle in the skies, Sunday. Tracking systems identified many ships, of varied make - several of which were appearantly destroyed. Debris rained down upon the nearby planet in a firey astronomical display, reportedly damaging a wasteland relay station. No casualties were reported. The identities of the pilots involved is still unknown, but rumors abound about a connection to the pirate activity in the region.
