Pashanai - The first casualties from the site of the Pashanai incident have been confirmed in excess of 4300, according to numbers just released by Amarr Navy High Command. Containment and relief operations are underway at the scene, with several station sectors still either on fire or suffering dangerous gas leaks.

It has also been reported that [Mervan Moritok](http://wiki.eveonline.com/wikiEN/index.php?title=Mervan_Moritok), the head of the Theology Council, may have been among those on the station at the time the explosion took place. Attempts to confirm this with the Empire are underway.

We will have more on the situation as it develops.
