# Holder disgrace
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/holder-disgrace

[Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) in the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
have to be vigilant in defending their position. Those who fail in the
Empire's cutthroat court may find themselves in **disgrace**.

Reasons
-------

This failure occur for any number of reasons, though the most likely one
is either to fall out of favor with the [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) or the royal [Amarr Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh), or to fall prey for the political
machinations of other Holders.

Results
-------

At least one outcome of being disgraced is for the Holder to be stripped
of his title (though Holders thus treated are allowed to retain their
Holder implants) and to have his family enslaved. Owning an ex-holder as
a slave is considered a sign of prestige.
