# Reclaiming
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/reclaiming

The **Reclaiming** is the term used for the [Amarr Empire's](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) methodical conquest and enslavement of other races throughout [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk). It is one of the core tenets of the Amarr faith, a driving force which has led the Empire to its great power and influence but has also been responsible for immense hate, distrust, and destruction in the cluster.

Definition
----------

Scholars, even the devout Amarr themselves, are still debating the exact
nature of the Reclaiming. To many Amarr, the Reclaiming is a sacred duty
passed down by God to the Amarr people, charging them with shepherding
the lost and faithless back into God's grace. It is a burden placed on
the Amarr to never falter, to never show cracks of sin, and always do
God's work in the mortal world.

To other Amarr, particularly those who take a more cynical view of
religion, the Reclaiming is simply the mechanism of Amarr supremacy.
Favored by God for their devotion and faith, the Empire is justified in
conquering others and using them in whatever method the Amarr see fit.
The lesser races are merely livestock to be worked until they can give
nothing more.

To most outsiders, the Reclaiming is nothing more than vile dogma used
by the Empire to oppress and exploit others. Rather than proving them to
be superior to other races, outsiders consider the Reclaiming proof that
the Amarr are morally bankrupt. In their eyes, unless the Reclaiming is
halted for good, the Empire is worth being rendered impotent and
isolated at best; utterly destroyed at worst.

History
-------

### Origins

The Reclaiming began in 20078 AD, shortly after the
[Udorians](723tMHRDvyldo15RMLMuqh) landed on [Amarr Island](4wZzhhUMIfR4ziHGaMOiLJ) on [Athra](1iTTAHnalOUkUy862B7GlG). The
introduction of foreign elements into Amarr society spurred rapid
change, leading religious leaders to realize that they must suppress all
outside elements, lest their power would be broken by the more open
Udorian culture.

Branding other cultures and religions heretical and in defiance to God's
grace, the Amarr launched the Reclaiming. Though the young Amarr Empire
had less population and resources than the rich, influential Udorians,
they were unified by religious fervor. The Udorians, meanwhile, existed
in a variety of fractured states, many of whom distrusted each other
significantly.

### Khanid encounter

An early turning point in the Reclaiming came when the Amarr first
encountered the [Khanid people](1IRIdXfOZrfl5BuFuabOh6).
Militant, sturdy, and bearing a long-burning dislike of the more
advanced Udorians, the Khanid jumped at the chance to join in the
conquest. They also proved eager religious zealots, quickly converting
to the Amarr religion and the promise of glory in God's service.

With the assistance of the Khanid, the Amarr methodically conquered and
enslaved the disparate Udorian states. By 20371 AD, the Udorians had
been completely subsumed, leaving the Amarr to turn on the other,
forgotten cultures of Athra. It took less than 200 years to finish their
conquest of the planet, which the Amarr later renamed Amarr Prime.

### Spacefaring conquests

The fervor of the Reclaiming diminished as opportunities for conquest
disappeared. When the Amarr rediscovered space travel, they located a
nearly-working star gate in their home system. Viewing this as a sign
from God that the Amarr Empire should seek out and conquer the entire
galaxy, the Reclaiming was relaunched with renewed enthusiasm.

Soon, they came across the [Ealur](6TgmS6RKjOYM1Id08VBZzk) in 21423 AD,
the first of many primitive cultures they eventually subsumed. Many of
the races they conquered have been forgotten, for they were too small
and minor to be recorded as anything but footnotes to history, deemed
worthy of nothing other than an eternity of slaving, and bred with
existing slave stock until little of their ethnicity remained. One such
tribe lived on the [Ni-Kunni](5zoewV2VJJnYgvWj0Khn1K) homeworld of [Mishi IV](7Bwu0uJL7wrbt0fUkszc0V);
while the Ni-Kunni are remembered, this tribe
was utterly crushed and reduced to mere half-breeds among
multitudes. Those whose cultures and languages were deemed worthy of
saving were left to dusty old texts pored over only by aged
scholars.

The Ni-Kunni were conquered roughly a thousand years ago, but were
mostly spared an extended tenure in [slavery](slavery)
thanks in part to the relatively quick discovery of the much more
numerous [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) shortly after.

### The Minmatar

Under the leadership of Emperor [Damius III](4YXvIhUK7GjrXhK4dZ5AOM)
in 22480 AD, the Amarr began their invasion and conquest of the
Minmatar, starting with the planet [Matar](5gheCRHTWLbi5jzbo5vvT6). The
Amarr sent six slave ships, each to a different planet in
[Pator](7MdCKy2OEJTpJSItRgx8DX), and quickly rounded up hundreds of millions
of people. At the same time, they destroyed all space ships and
infrastructure they found, in an effort to render any resistance or
escape impossible. Thanks to their superior technology, the Amarr made
short work of the Minmatar.

### The Gallente and other empires

For millennia, the Amarr had never faced a significant threat to the
Reclaiming. That changed in 23180 AD, when the Amarr first encountered
the [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK). Though smaller than the
Empire, the Federation was able to match the economic and military
strength of the Amarr. Additionally, the liberal, freedom-loving
Gallente resented everything the Amarr had long pronounced as beneficent
and just.

Soon after, the Amarr also encountered the fledgling [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) and the [Jove Empire](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G). The
Caldari were embroiled with trouble with the Gallente, so the Empire saw
fit to allow them to remain unconquered and hold the focus of the
Federation military.

The Jove, however, appeared to be a tempting target. In 23216 AD, in the
system of [Vak'Atioth](vakatioth), the Amarr invaded the
Jove Empire. The Amarr expected a quick subjugation; instead, they were
humiliated by a smaller but technologically superior Jove fleet.
Militarily bloodied and psychologically shaken, the Empire's plans of a
more carefully considered assault were dashed when the
[Minmatar rebelled](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N) en masse with assistance from
Gallente and Jove operatives.

### Decline of the Reclaiming

Since then, the Reclaiming has mostly ground to a halt. With the
Gallente Federation and Minmatar Republic standing opposed to them, the
Amarr have forgone any significant expansion in the past two centuries.
The first step toward its end was the Gallente-Amarr Free Trade
Agreement entered into in 23210. The Empire willingly entered into
Yulai Accords that founded [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) at the Yoiul
Conference, bringing them into a peace-footing with the other
races.

Under [Heideran VII](4Olxc4nxWd7y1mjFPhvHnV), the Empire took a more
passive, conciliatory tone toward the other empires. His successor,
[Doriam II](1aaBMbCysLA8uJjQQczFwT), continued this stance, declaring his
intention to bring peace and prosperity to the cluster. He even
released over fifteen thousand Minmatar slaves as a gesture of good will
to the Republic.

Many expected [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) to harshly reintroduce
the Reclaiming, and her coronration speech seemed to bear this out.
Months later, however, she surprised citizens in the cluster when she
announced that all Minmatar who had been enslaved for at least nine
generations, or were involved in religious or academic work, were to
immediately be emancipated. It is not known how genuine her
original proclamation of a new Reclaiming truly was, or whether it was
used as a propaganda tool to pacify the more militaristic parts of her
kingdom while she settled in as Empress.

Since her proclamation, no sustained effort to reignite the Reclaiming
has emerged in the Empire. The
[24th Imperial Crusade](3QsjSgklI3Le0W5KfKatW9) nominally fights for
Reclamation, as do various other forces, but their focus is usually on
other matters than direct slave acquisition - such as the lowsec
dominance war the 24ths are fighting by proxy.

Religious Justification
-----------------------

The Reclaiming has long been justified by the Amarr
[Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp), to the point where there is an
entire book of the Scriptures called the Book of Reclaiming. The
Book of Reclaiming states that at one point in the deep past, all
mankind was united under God's grace. However, humanity became
decadent and sinful and suffered a great fall. It was only the Amarr,
alone remaining pious and faithful through the dark times, who retained
God's favor. God named them the rightful masters of the world and
tasked the Amarr, through the leadership of the [Amarr Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ), with conquering the fallen people of
the universe and bringing them back to His grace.

There remains some dissension among theologians as to the true purpose
of the Reclaiming. Some believe that the Amarr are to forever remain
masters, keeping all other people perpetually beneath them. Many of the
more traditional, established [Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) families
ascribe to this viewpoint. This is also the view many outsiders have of
the Reclaiming, and it is commonly the first point made in criticism of
the Reclaiming.

However, the opposing view that has gained far more popularity in recent
decades is that the Amarr's true purpose is to elevate the other races
to their own level. Pointing to the level of respect shown the Khanid,
the presence of the Udorian [Tash-Murkon Family](4t1KEOTA8LvYIHDcOtIPAb)
in Amarr Royalty, the
near-universal freedom of the Ni-Kunni, the favored status of the
[Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz), and the recent emancipation of many
Minmatar, the Amarr claim that slavery offers a pathway toward
salvation. The Reclaiming is viewed as a sacred duty, with Amarr
citizens required by God to teach and guide the other races toward the
Amarr faith. Slavery is thus necessary penance for refusing to embrace
God.

Mechanism
---------

The Reclaiming is primarily carried out through conquest and
enslavement. Beginning with the Udorians and Khanid on the Amarr home
world, other races were conquered militarily, stripped of their culture,
and forced into slavery for generations.

Frequently, the Amarr rely on collaborators within enslaved races to
make the conquest proceed smoothly. Those that willingly convert to the
Amarr faith are frequently spared slavery and given favored status in
the Empire.

Holders are the primary beneficiaries of the Reclaiming, being given
cheap slave labor to work their vast estates. However, modern Holders
are expected to act as a moral and religious guide for their slaves,
eventually leading them to emancipation and a place in Amarr society.
While there are no hard laws against mistreating slaves in the Empire,
due to the difficult nature of proving such a thing, a Holder who
suffers through rebellions and has impious slaves is generally looked
down upon by his fellows.

Individual Holders may emancipate a slave and his family at any time, if
the Holder feels he has proven his faith and loyalty to the Empire.
Additionally, the Royal Heirs or even the Emperor himself may make a
decree freeing slaves of certain generations or vocations throughout
their holdings.
