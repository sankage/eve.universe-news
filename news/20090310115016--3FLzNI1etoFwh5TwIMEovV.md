LUMINAIRE - President Foiritan has issued an immediate recall of Federation ships along the Caldari border. The vessels were mobilized early this morning, shortly after reports of lost contact in the Seyllin system, and intended as a protective measure against a possible Caldari incursion.  
  
With the situation in Seyllin assessed and rescue operations underway, Foiritan has ordered the ships away from the border as a means to diffuse the day's tensions.  
  
State Executor Heth did not comment if the Caldari Navy would mirror the relaxation of force.
