**Ruebin** is a tourist who at one point visited [the Electric Museum](6FUymY4Xs59PihSLEs6u3Q). He appreciates art for
aesthetic reasons and makes a habit of visiting any museum wherever he
goes.

He did not appreciate the [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) style, but
entered the museum expecting to be ironically entertained by jingoistic
art. After investigating several of the displays, he joined up with the
tour being given by [Entrye Chrare](2M6na4iZkeZ4GqtRcpR2xK). Thanks to
the disinterest of museum guards, Ruebin was able to follow the group
into the special exhibit despite not having a ticket.

In there, he admired the graceful design of the modules at the beginning
of the exhibit and expressed open dismay once they suddenly became more
rigid and practical in design. Though the official story was the module
design had changed because two executives were caught in a corruption
scandal and resigned, Ruebin did not believe this to be the full truth.

Entrye became intrigued by his insights and offered to give him a
private tour after the museum closed, which Ruebin accepted. During that
private tour, Entrye told him the story of how the earlier modules were
designed by [David](3H01yyv6huJ5QjGhvOP55j), the former CEO of the [Kaalakiota Corporation](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK), and
[Yonate](6EWutHvfhZLE0KAKiJdTNM), the former CFO of
[Sukuuvestaa](1qDZvg69txboJlARXk4vKB), as hidden messages to
each other expressing their mutual love for one another. The discovery
of this love is what had led them to resign.

After hearing this, Ruebin believed the designs became so graceful and
expressive because the two wanted to be caught, in some sense. When
Entrye agreed and expressed admiration, Ruebin quickly became suspicious
and rebuffed what he thought were amorous advances from Entrye. This
enraged the museum curator, and Ruebin left as Entrye accidentally
knocked over several displays in his anger.
