Published on 2008-02-25T21:24:18 at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/alliance-tournament-v-competitors-introduction-part-v

The **Fifth Alliance Tournament** is almost upon us. This year’s entrants include a number of new, smaller and mostly unknown alliances as well as the established tournament veterans. 

Next in our series of Alliance introductions, we present _**The Red Skull** and **Green Alliance**_. 

**The Red Skull**

* * *

Although The Red Skull has been around for the better part of a year and a half, it has seen a number of executor corporations. The latest executor is Woopatang. Xornicon Altair, a director of Woopatang as well as Communications Officer for the alliance, tells us that The Red Skull is primarily a combat oriented alliance that currently holds a small constellation in Syndicate. Since taking over the executorship of Red Skull, Xornicon believes that Woopatang has brought the alliance to a position that makes them “able to stand against the best, and worst, this galaxy has to offer”. 

A minor clerical issue concerning who actually paid the entry fee caused some confusion and rumors that Red Skull had withdrawn from the tournament. The issue has been resolved and Red Skull will be participating.* 

The publicity of winning the tournament may help boost Red Skull’s membership, but Xornicon is confident that winning or losing will have no effect on Red Skull’s future plans. 

_*Recent reports from GalNet indicate that Red Skull may now be attempting to sell their tournament slot. A purchased tournament slot will not be honored by the Commission and as of this writing, Red Skull has not formerly withdrawn from the tournament._

_**Update** \- due to the uncertainty regarding TRS participation, organisers have now withdrawn them from the tournament._

**Green Alliance**

* * *

Founded just over a month and a half ago, Green Alliance is one of the smallest alliances in the tournament at just two corporations and 39 members. Ooke, Alliance Fleet Admiral of Green Alliance tells us that they are based out of Konora and have laid claim to the Insmother and Cache regions (both of which sovereignty indicators show to be under the control of Red Alliance.) 

Green Alliance is looking forward to exciting matches, with fame and prizes as added attractions. Ooke made a point of telling us that any increase in membership or resources gained as a result of winning the tournament will go directly into the continued harassment of Red Alliance members.

_More coverage will be available live during the tournament. The Red Skull will be engaging United Legion on Day One of the tournament. Green Alliance will face SMASH Alliance on the same day._
