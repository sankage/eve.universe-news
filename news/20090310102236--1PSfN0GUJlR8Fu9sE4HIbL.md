3HQC-6 0855 - Fluid router traffic linking a remote ORE expedition in Outer Ring with its headquarters in the Heart Constellation has been severed following reports of an emergency. Although ORE was unavailable for official comment, SCOPE has learned that the mining corporation dispatched a small task force to the Sword Constellation to investigate.

The lost expedition is believed to be prospecting on 3HQC-6 I, the system's innermost planet. Establishing fluid router communications is standard operating procedure for any remote mining or surveying operation, and disruption of established links is most commonly caused by equipment failures or accidents.

The expedition is believed to have been performing deep core surveys on the planet's interior when the emergency was sounded.
