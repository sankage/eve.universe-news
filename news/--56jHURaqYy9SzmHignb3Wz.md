**Project Skymother** was undertaken by the
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) corporation [Core Complexion Inc.](u4esGMynVEZ2DaTh3uuiY), with assistance from [Six Kin Development](66rfXuyEMXC62n4xGMJjFn), to develop a new ship
based on ancient technology researched by Dr. Chieran Kenitawri and his
team during Chieran's lifetime. The ship developed is of unknown
classification, contains jump drives, and was of such size that only a
small portion of it could be viewed at a time from a shuttle viewport.
