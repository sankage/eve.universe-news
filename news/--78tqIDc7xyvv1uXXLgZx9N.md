Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/kerrigan-orsha

**Kerrigan Orsha** is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo)
[Holder](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v).

Following the ascension of [Empress](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ) [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L), he berated her in a fiery speech in open court.
Following his outburst, the assembly dispersed into chaos, Orsha was
denounced by his own family, and he was judged and found guilty of
heresy.

Normally he would have been put to death, but Jamyl spared him. Instead,
she stripped him of all rank and privilege and offered him life on two
conditions: First, he had to retire to a convent, where he would study
the [Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp) for the rest of his life, and
second, he would have his entire body painfully tattooed with excerpts
from the Scriptures, interspersed with the names of his children and
grandchildren.
