PATOR - The Minmatar People's Theatre announced their new season today, drawing fire from media watchgroups outraged at the inclusion of what they call a "rascist" play. The MPT, who were the last group to receive funding from the now-defunct parliament, will stage a version of the 600-year-old 'Plantation' by Ammatar author Dekkameron. Though the play is considered by many a classic, at least one of the groups, Equality in Action, plans to protest the show. "There is no redeeming social value in this play whatsoever, and it is disgusting that government money would go towards perpetuating racist stereotypes" said Keinnan Bakkia the group's spokesman.
