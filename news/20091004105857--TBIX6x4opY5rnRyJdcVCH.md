Sasta, Derelik - The Ammatar Fleet has launched its first 'Yonis variant' Abaddon-class battleship from a military shipyard in Sasta, the Fleet HQ system. The launch is the first of an unspecified number of Abaddon-class battleships from the Ardishapur house fleet that are being refitted for duties with the Ammatar Fleet.

Designed for extended 'prestige patrol' duties on the Minmatar border, the 'Yonis variant,' named after Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur, is understood to have modified energy plants and does not carry the energy-hungry and crew-intensive tachyon beam batteries often seen on Imperial Navy Abaddon variants. The decision of the Ammatar Fleet to deploy the formidable Abaddon-class on the border with the Minmatar Republic is regarded by observers as yet another signal from Royal Heir Yonis Ardishapur that he considers it vital that the Mandate be a major contributor to the strategic goals of the Amarr Empire.
