# Multispectral Grenade
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/multispectral-grenade

A **multispectral grenade** is a weapon whose function and impact level
is chosen upon activation.

Like starship weapons, it has four main damage types: kinetic, thermal,
electromagnetic and explosive. In order, these cause shockwaves, fires,
electric disruptions, and classic bangs. A fifth damage type, optical,
distorts light and seriously disorients anyone whose optic nerves pick
up the signals.

The different levels of multispectral grenades mean that they can be
used variously to slow down pursuers, create momentary distractions,
cause intense damage to people and machines, or even kill anyone in the
vicinity.
