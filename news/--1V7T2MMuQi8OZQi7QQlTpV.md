# Muryia Mordu
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/muryia-mordu

Muryia Mordu was a [Caldari](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) officer who retired
from military life to found [Mordu's Legion](5csCeDqUe1exvVyfPdL75Q)
after the First Gallente-Caldari war.

### Early Life

Muryia was a Deteis born on Hakonen III. It was clear that he was to have a
significantly augmented path to greatness. The son of a Chief Risk
Officer for [Ishukone](7gc0ekpgJoQ3hygIB6ocHI) and a Senior Tech Officer initially under her
charge in the Caldari Navy, his parents' contribution to the State in
the ongoing Gallente-Caldari War meant they were able to afford quality
medical assistance during his mother's pregnancy and for months after
delivery.

Muryia's education befitted a child that demonstrated an aptitude as
both an academic and a leader. Regularly identified in school reports as
focused, strategic, hungry for knowledge, loyal, liberal and meticulous,
Mordu also managed to earn the respect of his peers despite his
dominance over many of them in the competitive environment of Caldari
schooling.

One significant blot on his record came in his thirteenth year, when he
managed to put another boy in hospital with significant spinal injuries
during a high tackle incident in a high profile contact sport
preliminary final. The injured boys parents made an official complaint
and intended to take the matter to the courts, saying that Muryia's
actions had been entirely deliberate, and that there had been incidents
between the boys before. Mordu faced expulsion, and while a subsequent
campus investigation was inconclusive, his reputation as a ruthless
enforcer reportedly haunted him throughout his youth and reputedly led
to his insistence that he act with honor (albeit often without mercy) in
his subsequent dealings with his enemies.

Muryia's parents were approached before his mandatory military service
to confirm what they already suspected - his military service would
extend far beyond common conscription. Mordu was officer material, much
like his parents, and as the war with the Gallente continued, adepts
such as he were invaluable to the Caldari war machine's longer term
efforts.

### The First Gallente-Caldari War

Muryia's first active duty also resulted in his first service medal.
Dispatched as part of a reinforcement to a besieged fleet trying to
extricate themselves from a protracted engagement in Iyen-Oursta in the
Gallente Border Zone. As a crippled Caldari presence attempted to remove
themselves to Perimeter. Several wings were sent in to protect their
extraction, with Mordu being on one of the first ships to come to their
aide. His ship was the last to leave the system, itself severely
damaged. The only target for several moments, the vessel bore the full
brunt of the Gallente forces as it approached the gate. Only an ensign,
Mordu had raced to the side of ship's captain after a hit wounded and
killed members of the bridge crew. He immediately applied compress to a
life-threatening wound to the throat of his superior officer and
proceeded to relay orders as the ship fled. It's said that at some point
the ship's captain had lost consciousness, though the orders still kept
coming.

As Mordu gained promotions and found increasing numbers of crew under
his command his missions typically involved assignment to fleets
providing orbital support or extracting ground forces during planetary
engagements throughout Verge Vendor and Placid. Shortly after becoming a
captain, it was his efforts in Intaki in YC8 that he was to earn the
most renown.

### Extraction from Intaki V

After several exchanges in the Woenckee and Viriette constellations, the
Condor under his command was attacked over Intaki V. Mordu and the other
crew that had managed to survive the ship's destruction and their own
subsequent descent to the planet were marooned on the surface. To
Mordu's apparent displeasure, he was informed that due to increased
enemy presence following the exchange, rescue was going to be denied
until orbit could be secured. Preparing themselves for an extended stay,
they managed to rendezvous with the soldiers they had been sent to
extract. They had then set about trying to dig in, blend in and secure
passage off the planet themselves. After a deal soured with a local
criminal contact, the men were sheltered by sympathetic Intaki for a
short time before the Caldari Navy came for them. It was likely this
experience that not only ensured Mordu's future career path but in many
ways changed his perspective on his own dispensability, the darker side
to his own character, particularly when in mortal combat, as well as his
capacity to engage with others on a blunter and more human level rather
than a structured and authoritative one.

While his continuing command in the field earned him recognition as a
brilliant young Caldari officer, Muryia also gained the reputation of
engaging in what those under his charge came to refer to as a "whiskey
session." This tradition was a legacy of his time on Intaki V. Sometimes
an honor, but on some occasions the death knell of someone's career, to
be invited into Muryia's quarters as he sat reviewing reports of an
evening to find whiskey and two glasses meant that you had gained
particular attention. What usually started with a review of recent
performance would become a less formal as the hours wore on. If you
lasted till morning, you could end up being promoted or entrusted with a
particular duty. If you left within minutes, you'd likely be facing a
transfer soon after. Reports held that Mordu did this in order to test
his troops' ability to function while under duress from exhaustion and
drugs, though several people who've participated in this kind of session
have later been quoted as saying that Mordu simply likes his drink.

Muryia was also said to be more open-minded than other Caldari officers,
who generally tended to xenophobia towards non-Caldari races. A boon of
his upbringing amongst the more liberal ideals inculcated by those loyal
to Ishukone, coupled with his experiences on Intaki V, Mordu
demonstrated that he was increasingly of the opinion that class or rank
did not determine the character of the person, nor the level of
expertise they possessed.

He would be later given command of Intaki officers who had chosen to
defect from the Gallente Federation to join the Caldari cause for
independence. Made up of a mix of navy and ground forces, Mordu was
given the rank of Brigadier General with the formation of this brigade
and charged with the continuation of a combination of fleet movements
and ground skirmishes in enemy territory.

He immediately took a liking to the Intaki under his charge, and
vice-versa. Together, they formed one of the more revered fighting units
in the Caldari Navy during the last years of the war with the
Federation, and their achievements were hailed as modern military
legend.

After the conflict ended in YC12, Muryia shocked many when he retired
from his military life. The Intaki under his command were invited to
stay in Caldari society and granted accommodation in Waschi City on
[Kamokor IV](yOVXgfGWF8UUaMX1vPAlK).

### Waschi Uprising

Over the many years that followed a nationalist movement took root on
the planet, centered on this city specifically due to the proportionally
large presence of the Intaki residents. Many were the subject of
victimization and xenophobic attacks, incidents which went unchecked by
local authorities as well. Eventually a full blown uprising against the
Caldari government began in YC32 when Caldari authorities attempted to
bring the city to order after almost daily violence. Intaki were being
forcibly removed from their homes and brutalized. After several deaths
the Intaki war veterans called upon the assistance of their old
commander to quell the Waschi Uprising. Muryia Mordu agreed to help his
fellow soldiers and formed a mercenary group which consisted mainly of
these Intaki war veterans. While they had all retired from active
service, they assisted Caldari authorities to crush the uprising with
the same efficiency that had defined them during the war, and started
referring to themselves as Mordu's Legion.

Due to Muryia's leadership the group's performance was noticed by
authorities. For their assistance in quelling the uprising, the Caldari
Navy offered Mordu and other leaders of the mercenary group
reinstatement and official position within the Navy. Muryia and his men
declined, instead announcing that Mordu's Legion were now freelance
military contractors.

### Recruitment and Allegiance

While Mordu made it known that the Legion would accept all races, he
also went to great lengths to make it know that he was not interested in
welcoming navy rejects, green recruits, disciplinary issues, enemies of
the state or people of questionable morals. To accept his amnesty was to
reject your allegiance to your past political constraints. Trespassers,
spies, and would-be vigilantes looking to settle old scores were
executed by firing squad and sent back to their respective nations in
flag-draped caskets. Muryia only wanted the best trained, most
disciplined and most honest. He made it a habit of meeting with every
recruit personally, if not overseeing their initial interview himself.

For a time, Mordu gained a reputation for poaching members of the
[Caldari Navy](7loPnB2q6sl7hzRzdylIPN) who had come to particular attention, such as battle-tested
Turek Mayon and logistical genius and rising star Teston Hrinz. Both men
encountered Muryia Mordu shortly before they were about to receive
significant promotions, Hrinz aboard his shuttle while enroute and Mayon
at a bar in the Caldari Navy Assembly Plant in Perimeter while he was
waiting to be seen.

Despite it straining relations in some quarters, Mordu always maintained
close ties with the Caldari State, and long-standing members of the Legion who retired where offered Caldari
citizenship upon retirement. The Legion also gained access to high-end
Caldari military gear, as well as frequent contracts from both military
and corporate quarters.

While Mordu demonstrated clear allegiance to his parent corporation, he
frequently accepted work from all the megacorporations, though with some
preferential treatment. He was known to be accepting a great deal of
contracts from [Kaalakiota](xW4SSaPMqTaHQ1RLt0IcK), for example, both before and after the
ousting and exile of once-CEO [Haatakan Oiritsuu](4IoWYbA7pgLuUu5fqlCVxs), whom he was known to have a
particularly fiery love-hate relationship. It has been rumored that his
son Arian, himself a member of the Legion, was the product of a union
with her, but this has never been substantiated. It's more likely that
he is one of the reasons their relationship grew to be so bitter.

### Becoming a Capsuleer

Mordu was cloned shortly after the creation of the transneural burn
scanner interface after being approached directly by [Otro Gariushi](5QydCJCoYvbvbWvFlAlbHg)
in YC104. Despite concerns about his advanced age and the transplantation of his consciousness into a
younger clone body, through force of will, the application of wealth,
and the gracious cooperation of Ishukone scientists, the procedure was a
success.

It has been noted that Mordu's cloning resulted in an increase in his
eccentricity and peculiar brand of humor. Said to be connected to
complications that arose as a result of his advanced age at the time, he
has himself dismissed any concerns as to his behaviour as a result of a
new lease on life he had gained. Always a man who believed in integrity
and speaking one's mind, Muryia notably became even more expressive,
occasionally offensively so. He also started wearing more garish attire,
including a wide variety of hats. Allies in the Legion would attest that
this was to cover up his custom implants, which featured prominently
along the sides of his scalp and behind the ear. There were suggestions
that his costuming was instead the clearest symptom of irregularities in
his behavior, alongside an increasingly blacker, warped sense of humor
and a tendency to refer to conversations he'd had with those that he'd
murdered, even long after their deaths.

Mordu's cloning was ultimately justified as his being an asset to the
Caldari cause and a chance to experiment with the cloning of a
significantly older subject. It became clear, however, that a deal had
been made between the CEO of Ishukone, once a member of the Guristas,
and Muryia Mordu. In the years leading up to the death of Otro Gariushi
in YC110 Mordu's Legion performed several key operations against assets
of the hated Guristas. Based on intelligence provided by the Ishukone
CEO, these precision strikes were led by a much more youthful figure who
the Legion still referred to as 'the old man'. Subsequent recruits to
the Legion assumed that this title was a reference to Mordu's
patriarchal concern for his men.

### Contract lost with ORE

In YC 106 Orion Mashel, the reclusive CEO of [Outer Ring Excavations](vtyIqELC7ngvFuWla7baP),
had a personal and heated meeting with
Muryia Mordu, which resulted in the mercenary commander storming out.
Mashel's reputation as a recluse meant that this visit to his
headquarters attracted media attention, as well as the eyes of New Eden.
 Several days later, Mordu's Legion was seen mobilizing on a large
scale, reportedly under the direct command of Muryia Mordu himself.
The taskforce then penetrated deep into Serpentis Corporation
space, avoiding all conflict with Serpentis forces as they orbited an installation in the
heart of their territory and utilized an unknown device against a
chemical storage facility. They then promptly left without any
damage to their own assets, and were pursued by Guardian Angel
forces responding to the incursion.
Several Legion ships were reported destroyed in skirmishes that followed
despite Mordu himself and the bulk of his fleet returned to headquarters
unharmed. In an emergency meeting that followed, Mordu organized
defensive pickets around ORE facilities to safeguard against further
retaliation by Serpentis and their [Angel Cartel](23YuvVn4HtUfRW2gAAn9mA) backed forces. Many other Legion forces
were left marauding in the Fountain region, proving to be a thorn in the side of the Serpentis. A week later the Serpentis and Cartel forces began a campaign to push the Legion forces
out of Fountain, which eventually succeeded as Mordu yielded the field. The Legion's actions unsettled many factions including several prominent capsuleer alliances, all of whom publicly demanded answers
from the mercenary group. Mordu, not being a man who appreciates having
his motives questioned, gave none.

Following this, tensions clearly rose between the Legion and ORE,
leading to the opinion that the incursion into Serpentis space was
against the wishes of Mashel, or that Mordu himself opposed the campaign
and was pressured by ORE. [Serpentis](3igWGHqQJXyJoUnM2XgGJC) capitalized on the souring
relationship and announced their buyout of large portions of ORE shares,
even as as reports of a hostile annexing of 4C-B7X filtered out despite
a communications blackout. Both the buyout and the events of what
some referred to as the "Serpent's Massacre" put the Serpentis
Corporation in a position of control over ORE policy, likely
contributing to the decision to revoke the Mordu's Legion contract for
protection. In exchange this buyout secured ORE assets against further
hostile interference from Serpentis and their allies among the Angel
Cartel.

### Intaki Prime and Ishukone

Following Caldari occupation of the Gallente systems, designated as a
contested zone under the [CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act](39y03QDhd4N8GXwoV2zSha), in YC111 the Caldari Providence Directorate held a blind
auction for the administration and development rights to the systems
under their control. [Intaki](17xNygfKnuI4d0t0JHAU0Z) was the
only system awarded to the Ishukone Corporation. In a deal with the
Mordu's Legion and the Intaki Assembly, both corporations moved in to
provide security and commercial shipping services to the planet's
governing authority.

This was revealed to be a mutual business deal between Ishukone, the
Legion and the Intaki Assembly, who retained rights under Gallente laws
to [franchise](7nwbW8LIvwRIDCFoi2E6vX) both services as they saw fit. Muryia Mordu had
leveraged his close ties with both partners, and while security had been
traditionally handled by the Federation Navy,
in March YC112 the Legion arrived in
the system with Ishukone commercial ships, who themselves had taken
over commercial shipping from [FedMart](2Aa82GwowUlH7gWR8uItZU). Despite the
auction results having been announced the previous year, until this
point no movement had transpired on Ishukone's part. Furthermore, the
system control had been retaken by the Federal Defense
Union militia a week previous. The
FDU were spurred to action over the reports and large conflicts took
place over the contested planet. This was followed by a plea from the
Intaki Assembly for a cease fire, directed at the FDU, as they declared
both corporations to be "present in Intaki at the specific and
un-coerced request of the Assembly." Later that day the
Federation Navy attempted to reassert control over the system by sending
a fleet under the control of Admiral Gouenette. The fleet was refused
entry at the Intaki stargate in Agoze, and
the Intaki System Command informed the admiral they were "neither
required nor welcomed." While Ishukone are prohibited from sending
any armed military ships to operate in Intaki, the Mordu's Legion are
given full authority to police the local space and were given full
military access, subject to civilian oversight by the Intaki Assembly.
All of the negotiations involving the Legion in this deal where attended
by Muryia Mordu himself, and there has been a great deal of speculation
as to how many of the meetings that took place where done in back rooms
rather than minuted board rooms subject to official oversight.

### Battle of Pike's Landing

Muryia Mordu was personally involved in the conflict that occurred in
Amamake, in Heimatar, centered around the Pike's Landing battlefield on
the temperate planetary surface. A large element of Mordu's Legion
forces jumped into orbit around his Wyvern-class supercarrier, all
within close proximity to the Amarr fleet that had infiltrated the
system. Collisions occurred as well as losses when an Avatar-class Titan
fired it's doomsday weapon, obliterating several Mordu's Legion
interceptors as it attacked a Republic Fleet carrier.

While the exact motives of the Amarr, Gallente and Caldari fleet
elements under the leadership of Mens Reppola that were present in the
fray have not been made publicly available, it is clear that Pike's
Landing was the common reason for their aggressive presence in Republic
territory. Witnesses testify to furious fighting on the surface, and the
presence of ships with the markings of Mordu's Legion. CONCORD is still
investigating, but it has been suggested that the battle was connected
to the development of cloned soldiers, particularly in light of Mordu's
subsequent connection with the activities of cloned mercenaries
alongside those fighting for the empires across New Eden. 

### Mordu's Private Trials and Challenge

In YC114, before the purges that were to eventually happen in the
subsequent year, Muryia Mordu issued a series of challenges for cloned
mercenaries. It became apparent that he had seen this new technology in
operation in private trials and had been doing so since he had provided
sanctuary to the first cloned soldier, who went rogue and broke away
from his Amarr overlords. Mordu only confirmed that he had been privy to
reports that detailed how cost effective and efficient they were proving
for the empires developing the technology in a public statement, also
stating that he wanted to see their results in action for himself. As
these troops started entering into the freelance marketplace, setting up
mercenary companies of their own and breaking away from the empires,
Mordu challenged them to prove that "they're even one-tenth as good as
my guys..."

> The Legion has plenty of surveillance equipment and we're pretty well
> tapped in to the goings on in public mercenary contracts. I'm going to
> release a list of challenges...(L)et's see what these cloned mercs can
> do.

Aware that scores of independents who are willing and able to die and
die again presented a threat to the Legion's standing, it was clear that
the challenge was a way to both test them and incite infighting amongst
the new outfits. It worked. Mordu backed up his promises with weapons,
dropsuits, and equipment for the clone soldiers, who launched into
public contracts in direct opposition to each other. Their exchanges not
only demonstrated the power of the new order, but the violence they were
capable of that would later result in their condemnation, most notably
by Gallente President Jacus Roden.

### Events on Caldari Prime

Following the events of Operation Highlander, a concerted effort by the
Gallente Federation to retake [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i)
from the Caldari State, the planet was declared
a demilitarized zone in a treaty by both sides. Following the
destruction on the planet during the conflict, caused mostly by the
remains of the Leviathan class *Shiigeru* titan crashing to the surface,
the administration of the planet was divided into two
districts, Gallente and Caldari controlled. Soon afterwards, Muryia
Mordu issued a statement announcing that Mordu's Legion had been
appointed as planetary security.

> Ishukone and Material Acquisitions will remain in firm control of the
> Caldari and Gallente districts, respectively. We will provide regular,
> full reports to both them, the Chief Executive Panel, and Gallente
> Senate in order to preserve transparency and ensure we are providing
> fair and neutral oversight of the planet.

From their appointment as security the Legion received praise from both
administrations for their handling of the civilian populace. While
complaints against the Legion have been made for some instances of
heavy-handedness, overall no major incidents have arisen. Documented
cases of the Legion successfully calming or neutralizing outbreaks of
violence state they have been both effective, and even-handed in their
duties. Muryia Mordu would not have had it any other way.

### Recent Events

As testament to the calibre of the research and development that those
under his command have been conducting, CONCORD announced in YC 116 that
three new ships had been registered for deployment by Mordu's Legion: A
frigate class, the Garmur; a cruiser class, the Orthus; and a battleship
class, the Barghest. Disclosed statistics for the ships displayed a
preference for advanced missile technology and long range warp drive
disruption, seemingly derived from both Caldari and Gallente technology.
Testament to Mordu's policy of leaving allegiances to political powers
behind, these ships have been designed to serve a professional
peace-keeping force that has served to bridge the gap between Gallente
and Caldari on more than one occasion. It was later revealed that the
Legion had acquired the use of one of Ishukone's think-tanks,
Kiiragustektaa, to help design a new ship, fitting to the needs of the
Legion in their new role in Intaki in particular. Muryia Mordu's
reputation as a keen negotiator and increasingly neutral intermediary
are now evidenced by military assets born of cooperation and a desire
for security rather than simple superiority in protracted conflict.

It's also no surprise that Mordu's reputation, as well as the recent
actions of his Legion, have led to a swelling of his ranks. Their rapid
response and clear willingness to get involved has earned them plenty of
additional friends within the Caldari Navy and Megacorporation security forces.
Recruitment activity is at an all time high as the Legion has been
actively seen seeking new recruits among the disaffected soldiers in the
current warzones. Fuelled by the recent turmoil following the dissolving
of the Caldari Providence Directorate and Tibus Heth's regime, many
Caldari soldiers have taken to joining the Legion, and Gallente military
personnel who witnessed Mordu's Legion operate on Caldari Prime are also
seeking to be led by Muryia Mordu.
