Myyhera - Taking advantage of the current turmoil around Sarum Prime and the retreat of the 7th Fleet from The Bleak Lands region, the Blood Raiders have allegedly launched opportunistic raids on numerous stations. Rumors are circulating of a large-scale raid into a capsuleer training facility, thought to house dozens of pilots in training. The normally high-security complex is understood to have lost all power for as long as an hour, leaving any pilots within vulnerable. With both CONCORD and Ammatar forces floundering amidst the confusion, there has been no confirmation or denial of the raid.
