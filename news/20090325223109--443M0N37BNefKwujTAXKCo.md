::: TRANSMISSION FROM STATE PROTECTORATE COMMAND :::

::: TO ALL STATE PROTECTORATE CAPSULEERS :::

The State Protectorate command issues their compliments to the militia in the recent re-securing of the Black Rise region.

The Gallente's Federal Defense Union militia has called for the siege of two sovereign Caldari systems, Raihbaka and Martoh, in the Inolari constellation of Black Rise. They maintain the false pretense of stolen equipment as a justification for a fresh push into the region. This is a blatant aggression on their part purely to secure mineral assets urgently required for civilian development projects and industrial applications in the Black Rise region.

Intelligence has intercepted a leaked communication that the Federation Navy have a small window of opportunity for their plans to succeed. As of today, this window stands at fifteen days.

Objective is as follows: To prevent the Gallente taking control of the Raihbaka and Martoh systems by any means necessary.

This is an attack on our civilian populous, as well as on our integrity, and shall not go unanswered. No mercy for enemies of the State!
