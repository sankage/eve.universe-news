Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/court-chamberlains-antechamber

The **antechamber of the Court Chamberlain** is a site on [Amarr Prime](bHRN1rfoBSiLCOFANsGI4).

It has a high ceiling that ended in tinted windows that changes color based on the strength of the sunlight. In the afternoon it is golden, in the evening blood red, and in the morning uplifting and bright. The walls are covered in icons and tapestries of the five [Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh), important [Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v), and depictions of previous [Emperors](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ). In his time, [Dochuta Karsoth](1qDadkKQ3HzwYZpl2r4JLL) also enjoyed access to a hidden passageway that led to a room often used for orgies and consumption of drugs.
