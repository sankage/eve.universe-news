**MTACs (Mechanized Torso-Actuated Chassis)** are metal exoskeletons
used for heavy duty mining work. They are armed with mining lasers and
can be remote controlled or worn by miners.

MTACs make for effective emergency weapons in combat, as they are heavy,
virtually immune to anti-personnel laser weapons, and have large,
dangerous claws. Some have surface cling abilities that allow them to
maneuver in zero gravity.
