# Holders
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/holders

Holders are the ruling class of nobility in the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo),
sitting below the [Royal Heirs](54zoGW31RF0k0QF9KkOBjh) in the feudal hierarchy. Holders
directly govern the majority of the Empire and its affiliated areas.
Having existed prior to the Empire itself, Holders are one of the oldest
institutions in Amarr culture apart from religion itself.

History
-------

### Early years

Holders as a class predate the establishment of the Amarr Empire.
The earliest Holders were the land-owning elite on the
[Amarr Island](4wZzhhUMIfR4ziHGaMOiLJ), ruling over fiefdoms of workers and
bonded laborers. They possessed no official authority other than that
which they were able to grab themselves, leading to frequent power
struggles. Many early Holders were little more than warlords who raised
armies and managed to conquer and hold onto a parcel of land. While some
Holder dynasties formed in the early years, most fiefs fell apart upon
the death of the Holder, to be gobbled up by opportunistic rivals and
rising warlords.

Holders in the modern sense did not arise until the crowning of the
first [Emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ),
[Amash-Akura](4tm7IOIn0xaGeNFQcRl0Lc). Amash-Akura was a highly
religious warlord who managed to unite the entirety of the Amarr Island
under his rule. He established the Holders as a hereditary noble class
and divided his empire into numerous holdings, granting them to his
closest allies and using them to appease his enemies. At the same time,
Amash-Akura used his influence to bring the secular and religious realms
even closer together by founding the [Council of Apostles](nTZLcvZprqLLUiGIaVQu7).
The Council was a group of
highly religious Holders and trusted clergy who would assist him in
ruling and, upon his death, choose his successor.

Within several generations, the Holder class had nearly completely
merged with the church. Holders were expected to be educated in
religious matters to the point where they could generally act with the
authority and knowledge of Amarr priests, and indeed, many Holders were
ordained members of the clergy itself. With their combined secular and
theological authority, the Holders gained immense power and became the
backbone of Amarr society.

It was during this time that the [Speakers of Truth](3vA8Xh4A10DiybH2UTOEUO)
were founded, as an attempt by the
Holders to maintain their religious and secular power in the event of an
Emperor antagonistic to their own desires.

### Reclaiming

By the time the [Udorians](723tMHRDvyldo15RMLMuqh) reached [Amarr Island](4wZzhhUMIfR4ziHGaMOiLJ),
the Holder class had been relatively
stable for centuries. Contact with another civilization threw the group
into upheaval. While the Holders had long been constrained by hereditary
land ownership and the enforced peace of the Emperor and Council of
Apostles, the Udorians shifted the balance of power. Holders in coastal
regions grew in power, as did those who were savvy enough to engage in
trade with the Udorians.

The older Holder elite, led by the Council of Apostles, felt they risked
being undermined by the rising power of formerly-weak Holders, as well
as those who welcomed the Udorian presence. This was one of many reasons
that prompted the launch of the [Reclaiming](70QLNGRwCwHUgmcjTmuhsA).

As the Amarr Empire conquered the Udorians and
[Khanid](1IRIdXfOZrfl5BuFuabOh6), the holder class underwent a shift. The
more powerful Holders in the Empire were able to claim huge swathes of
land and [slaves](slavery). However, it soon became apparent
that they would be unable to maintain these holdings on their own. It's
at this point that the first subservient Holders arose, as the larger
Holders gave lesser titles of nobility to underlings and had them rule
the land in their stead.

At the same time, the massive overtaking of new land meant that new
Holders were needed. For the most part, lesser branches of Holder
families were made Holders in their own right. However, for the first
time, commoners were afforded the opportunity to rise into the Holder
class, as exceptionally skilled generals and war heroes were made
nobility by the Emperor and granted titles, land, and slaves.

Additionally, it was at this time that the importance of Holders shifted
from land-owners to slave-owners. At the time, the Amarr were ethnically
the minority, with their Udorian and Khanid slaves outnumbering them.
The task of transforming the slaves into members of Amarr society was
given to the Holders.

The number of Holders exploded as the Amarr Empire conquered the
entirety of [Athra](1iTTAHnalOUkUy862B7GlG). Once the planet was firmly under
the control of the Amarr, the class once again stabilized.

### Expansion into Space

As the Amarr gradually rediscovered space flight and star gates, it
became apparent that more holders would be required to govern the new
Imperial territories. Much as it had during the early days of the
Reclaiming, the holder class expanded in both number and complexity. At
the highest level, Holders oversaw entire systems, with celestial bodies
ruled by underlings who had their own subservient Holders that oversaw
continents and other smaller divisions of territory.

The first non-Amarr Holders rose during this period as well.
Collaborators among the Khanid and Udorians had always been given
favored status by the Empire, but had never been made actual Holders. By
the time the Empire was truly expanding into space, many Udorians and
Khanid had been freed from slavery and the Empire was more tolerant of
them in religious roles. Though always outnumbered by their Amarr
masters, Udorians and Khanid families were granted titles of nobility
and Holder status. The [Tash-Murkon Family](4t1KEOTA8LvYIHDcOtIPAb) was one of the early
beneficiaries of this expanded policy.

### Moral Reforms

Following the [Moral Reforms](48nuiRGJ4i8BwACDI9a58u), the Council of
Apostles was abolished, severely curtailing the power of the Holder
class in the Empire. The [Privy Council](privy-council) rose
in its place. Five powerful Holder families who had supported the
Emperor were named the Five Heir Families and became the royalty of the
Empire. Each of the five families were given their own domains in
the Empire, making all other Holders subservient to them.

This situation continues to the modern day.

### Hierarchy

Holders have an extremely complex and, at times, convoluted hierarchy.
At the top of the ladder are the Five Royal Heirs, the descendants of
the Privy Council who were made royalty and potential heirs to the
Imperial Throne. Beneath the Heirs are a variety of less powerful
nobles. The exact hierarchy of Holders differs from region to region and
even system to system.

In general, at the lowest level are Holders who own a small parcel of
land on a celestial body or portion of a system. These Holders typically
own a small number of slaves and are in some ways little better than
commoners. More wealthy and powerful Holders may claim continents or
even entire planets under their domain. These Holders may or may not
have a system of subservient Holders under them, depending on historical
conventions. In general, the longer an area has been under Amarr
control, the more likely it is to have a more extensive pyramid of
leadership. As technology has advanced and allowed individual Holders to
oversee larger and larger domains, the need for lesser Holders has been
reduced, though the glacial pace of societal progress in the Empire
makes it unlikely that lesser Holders in older territories will ever be
fully eliminated.

Above the planetary Holders are system overseers. In densely populated
or rich areas, system overseers only control a single system. In lesser
regions, individual Holders may claim domain over several systems.

### Titles

The only official title within the Empire for Holders is simply Holder.
The title of Holder may be held by either a man or a woman, with Lord or
Lady being the proper form of address. Some titles have indications of
holdings, such as the title Holder of Dakba.

Certain Holders, for historical or traditional reasons, take more
extensive titles, such as Duke. These titles may denote higher
levels of authority.

### Heredity

All Holder titles are hereditary, passing from one Holder to his
designated heir. In most circumstances, the heir is one of the Holder's
children. Occasionally, a Holder will die without offspring; in this
case, the title may pass to a sibling, cousin, or even a spouse. Very
rarely, a Holder will die without any relatives. In these cases, the
title may be passed to another noble who has been named heir. In the
event of no viable heir, the title may be dissolved entirely, reassigned
by higher authorities to another Holder, or kept in abeyance until the
title can be awarded to a new Holder.

### Role

Holders are the absolute authority in their holdings. They make and
enforce laws, set and collect taxes and tariffs, engage in diplomacy
with corporations, other Holders, and foreign dignitaries, and oversee
their own private businesses. Lower level Holders must also ensure that
their local ordinances fall into line with those of their overseers.

Aside from rule, Holders are also responsible for the religious
education and conversion of slaves. While many Holders see slave
ownership merely as an opportunity for free labor, the Empire encourages
Holders to bring slaves into the Empire as productive citizens. Of
course, it is expected that many generations will pass before a slave
line is considered properly indoctrinated, so Holders are under no
pressure to turn all his slaves free. However, a Holder who owns a large
number of slaves that are never freed into Amarr society will generally
be looked down upon by his fellows for failing the calling of the
Reclaiming and [Scripture](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp).

Traditionally, Holders are the sole legal owners of slaves within the
Empire. However, the situation has become significantly murkier in
recent years. Aside from slave owning [Ammatar](2RCNqNOW8kV95yCFhjfhnz) in
the Mandate, the rise of the [capsuleers](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) has
challenged the old order. Many capsuleers of Amarr descent use slave
crews and others regularly engage in the slave trade and slave
ownership. Some have privately grumbled about the erosion of Holder
rights and responsibilities, but others have welcomed the increased
revenue provided by capsuleers in purchasing slaves.

Virtual all Holders own their own businesses, with more powerful and
wealthy Holders frequently having several. The majority of Holders spend
most of their times dealing with their private business ventures. A
Holder who makes bad business decisions can quickly find himself in debt
to his fellow Holders and find his holdings quickly diminishing.

Historically, Holders acted as the primary religious and judicial
official for their holdings. In modern times, this is rarely the case,
as the [Theology Council](38uUjWk3RiR80FqDwjmQWk) and [Civic Court](6PN5mrPP1saTCbZuq48GbO)
are more available to the public. Holders
still retain the right to make binding judgments on secular matters and
are expected to be respected in religious matters except in the gravest
circumstances.

### Relations between Holders

The sometimes labyrinthine interactions between Holders perhaps consumes
more effort than anything else a Holder does. Politics between Holders
is delicate and often dangerous, as Holders frequently look for ways to
diminish rivals and expand their own power.

History is rife with stories of Holders ruining rivals and having
them stripped of title and power. While the majority of conflicts
between Holders is limited to backroom dealings and attempting to expose
indiscretions, sometimes they turn violent. Holders have been known to
attempt to assassinate rivals and, in times of chaos or with an
approving Heir, open warfare between Holders has erupted.

All is not blood and deceit, however. Marriage between two families is a
common way of increasing the power of Holders. Holders also occasionally
sell individual holdings and titles in order to finance businesses or
cover debts. They can also be transferred as the result of legal
grievances. Holders can willingly transfer titles to other members of
the nobility. Though such acts always require the approval of their
ruling Heirs, such things are typically granted as a matter of course.

### Destitute Holders

An unusual condition that is not often easily understood by outsiders is
that of the destitute Holder. As a title cannot be lost except through
act of law or intent from the Holder himself, there will occasionally
arise a Holder who has lost the majority of his holdings and wealth
through misfortune or poor judgment, yer retain his title. Such a Holder
is known as a destitute Holder.

Destitute Holders have no property or wealth of their own and, as a
result, have very little influence or method of restoring their family
to prominence. In some ways, destitute Holders are worse off than
commoners, as tradition and honor demands that they not take on "common"
work, meaning they cannot turn to manual labor or other methods of
establishing savings. Destitute Holders therefore rely heavily on the
generosity of other Holders to house him and his family, provide his
children with an education, and assist in recovering lost assets.

Despite popular tales telling of destitute Holders rising from the ashes
to reclaim past glories, such stories are frequently little more than
fiction. Destitute Holders may find a benefactor from time to time that
attempt to help them recover, but such generosity only lasts so long
before it wears thin. More commonly, the destitute Holders quietly die
and their lines come to an end, with children married off to whomever
will accept them and their title passed on to a more able Holder.

In modern times, destitute Holders are rare. They were more common in
the past, particularly following the [Minmatar Rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N),
when the Holders of various
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) planets were expelled from their
holdings. The majority were left penniless and either absorbed into
other holder families or simply died out. A few still remain; most
notably the so-called Duke of [Pator](7MdCKy2OEJTpJSItRgx8DX), who rents a
small office in a station in Pator and regularly sends out
pronouncements to his "people." Though the Duke is descended from a
former Pator-based Holder, he is viewed as a harmless eccentric by the
locals and largely ignored.

### Holders and nobility

Though all Holders are nobility, it is not true that all nobility are
Holders. A Holder's entire family, even distant cousins and aunts and
uncles, are considered nobility, but only the title owner himself is
considered a Holder. This is sensible, once the status of a Holder's
children is considered. Only one can receive the title of Holder, but it
would be unthinkable for the others to suddenly become commoners.

Such children are known as non-titled nobility. They frequently become
theologians, professors, judges, military officers, or other acceptable
noble lines of work. This is considered beneficial to the Holders, as
their relations serve as important contacts within the Imperial
bureaucracy.

### Former Holders

A Holder can be stripped of his title for any number of crimes. These
crimes are normally religious in nature, such as insulting the
Empress, refusing an Imperial law, heresy, or any number of
other offenses. Rarely, a Holder may be stripped of his title or demoted
to a less prestigious title by an Heir for failure to adequately perform
his duties.

A Holder who has been stripped of his title becomes a commoner, as does
every member of his family. In the event the Holder has committed a
heinous crime, he and his family may be enslaved. Former Holders are
prized slaves among Holders, who view them as trophies.

### New Holders

New Holders are appointed rarely, especially in the modern era.
Typically, such appointments are reserved for when the Empire conquers
new territory and thus requires a new group of Holders to govern. New
Holders are typically selected from the untitled nobility, especially if
they are heavily involved in the conquest or have served the conquering
leaders with distinction.

Occasionally, a commoner may be elevated to the rank of Holder. This
typically occurs when the commoner has done a great service to the
Empire or is of such wealth, distinction, and renown that it would be
foolish to deny them. War heroes are among the most frequent commoners
to be granted entry into the Holder class, a fact the
[Imperial Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g) uses to its full advantage in recruitment.

### Demographics

The vast majority of all Holders are of the [True Amarr](2DkiJVfiL1RYP5y7AJGSNN)
bloodline. A small number of these Holders
possess Udorian ancestry, though outwardly they are indistinguishable
from True Amarrs. Though it is considered mildly disgraceful to have
Udorian blood, the prejudice against it has slowly faded from all but
the most conservative Amarr.

A significant minority of Holders are Khanid. As staunch allies of the
Amarr during the early days of the Reclaiming, the Khanid did not suffer
slavery for long. Many impressed their Amarr masters so much that they
were given status equal to nobles. When the Reclaiming expanded into
space, these noble and loyal Khanid were easy choices to become new
Holders. Though they are only a fraction of their Amarr counterparts,
and many fled to the [Khanid Kingdom](5VtgxEr1vnxuazt8lvQLoj)
following the [Khanid Rebellion](4O0h6TYzDTC6bEHncE0ICQ), they
still make up an important minority.

There are few [Ni-Kunni](5zoewV2VJJnYgvWj0Khn1K) Holders, though that
number is likely to increase in the coming generations. The few Ni-Kunni
Holders that exist are primarily the descendants of early collaborators
during the Amarr conquest of [Mishi IV](7Bwu0uJL7wrbt0fUkszc0V). Most
Ni-Kunni Holders remain in [Aridia](uPYIH9Hhde0bYIaZFR4eB), a relatively
poor and often-neglected region of the Empire. However, as more Ni-Kunni
merchants gain influence in the Empire, and the current Ni-Kunni Holders
gain in prestige, it is likely the number will increase and may one day
rival the Khanid minority in size.

No Holders exist of other bloodlines, though the Ammatar leaders in the
Ammatar Mandate have frequently been referred to as Holders in all but
name. The recent emancipation of slaves by [Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L)
is likely to lead to a few Holders of Minmatar decent within several
generations. Additionally, there is some pressure within the Mandate to
have the Ammatar leadership made officially into Holders.

Holders in the Khanid Kingdom
-----------------------------

Holders in the Khanid Kingdom are in many ways identical to their Empire
counterparts. They retain many of the same governing and slave-owning
functions. However, there are several main differences that set them
apart.

The largest difference is the relative power of the Kingdom Holders.
While in the Empire, all Holders are subservient to an Heir, in the
Kingdom they must answer solely to the King. [Khanid II](5HlA8KgFOuLy4jTf3t54xf)
has proven to be a somewhat hands-off ruler,
allowing his Holders to rule in what manner they see fit.
Additionally, there is no Theology Council or centralized religious
authority in the Kingdom aside from the King, so the Kingdom Holders
assume many of the duties undertaken by the priesthood in the Empire.

In many ways, Kingdom Holders resemble the Holders of the pre-Moral
Reforms Empire.

Additionally, a larger portion of Holders in the Khanid Kingdom belong
to the Khanid bloodline. Though the majority are still of True Amarr
descent, a large number of Khanid Holders owed their loyalty to the
Khanid Family and accompanied Khanid II in his revolt against the
Empire.
