**Jatek** is a crew member on board the same ship as
[Lazar](63JYAW179cJVl3tzBiGpCO). During the latter's tenure, he disappeared
from the ship after visiting a station, only to return several days
later with a new face. He seemed nonplussed by his new visage, though
Lazar was very disturbed by it. Lazar later saved him from a circuit
board fire.
