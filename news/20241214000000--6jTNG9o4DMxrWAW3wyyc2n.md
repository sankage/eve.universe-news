### Planetary Defense Hacks Halt as Vanguard Retreat

Gulmorogod IV – Ground sources on the prior host planet of an Angel insurgency FOB confirmed a halting of Deathless planetary defense network disruptions yesterday. This coincided with a reported drawing-back of “Vanguard” warclone deployments from the planet, concluding a two week period of action that began in the Raihbaka system. 

In this location as well as the previous Guristas insurgency in Raihbaka, Vanguard were widely reported engaging in combat on both sides of conflicts in significant numbers, with higher rates of pirate support overall. Vanguard activity ultimately enabled a Guristas victory in Raihbaka, and contributed greatly to Cartel operations in Gulmorogod. Notably, despite a consistent disadvantage in raw numbers, Legion-aligned Vanguard claimed the majority of skirmish victories on seven of fourteen days of activity. Many have attributed this spread of loyalties to the core Vanguard population's primary origin as “first-generation” warclones who sought refuge offered by the Angels, Guristas, and Legion beginning in [early YC115.](https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/mordus-legion-and-angel-cartel-join-guristas-in-offering-to-aid-caldari-targets) 

With Vanguard deployments no longer occupying planetary defense infrastructure sites, pirate activity previously attracted to these remote areas has returned to previous targets. Local reactions have been varied, with much discussion centering on the Deathless Wraiths' apparent decision to not directly provide the means to hack planetary defense infrastructure to pirate forces.

“On one hand, these defense hacks and Vanguard skirmishes pulled the majority of conflict far away from civilian districts,” stated local news personality Hesmira Rattosk of affiliate program *Gulmorogod WorldWide*. “On the other, this means we’re dealing with an organization well beyond Empire or CONCORD authority happily insinuating itself as a third party in pirate activity that only became possible in the first place because of infrastructure *they provided.*"

Rattosk concluded: “First the Circle markets shipcaster and FOB access to pirates, making them dependent. Next they show off an unprecedented ability to hack planetary defenses, keep it to themselves, and jump in as middlemen for these next-gen warclones offering their services on either side, leaving both insurgents and the Legion with no choice but to employ them. Bald-faced war profiteering aside, if this ‘Deathless’ and his allies are trying to make their tech and services a necessity, they’re damn well succeeding.”

### Vanguard Freelance Trials Produce Mixed Outcomes

In the far reaches of nullsec, Vanguard freelance trials conducted by the Agency network’s controlling mercenary organizations yielded significant yet highly varied results on planets threatened by emerging resistance to Equinox workforce colonies.

Vanguard activity on DHR-H7 VII (Branch) and JZV-F4 II (Vale of the Silent) strongly favored Guristas and Deathless operations respectively. Contracts from Guristas agent Ohminen Sin supporting raids on local colony assets proved exceptionally popular, with completions totaling over twice the number reported for all but one other offering. This sole exception was on JZV-F4 II, where tasks dispensed on behalf of the Deathless Circle by “The Peacock” resulted in the stonewalling of Society of Conscious Thought acquisition efforts.

Concurrently, Equinox colonies on H74-B0 II (Querious) and 4-EFLU II (Wicked Creek) reported overwhelming support from freelancers. Asset denial operations under Mordu’s Legion Strike Commander Tsuni Aina sustained the highest completion ratio of all recorded contracts, significantly hampering Salvation Angel activity. Assistance rendered on H74-B0 II likewise enabled colony personnel to resist Blood Raider strikes targeting Upwell cloning materials, counteracting overall higher support for these pirates versus the opposing forces of the Order of Saint Tetrimon.

Meanwhile, in the background of respective Angel and Guristas operations, new retrievals of cloning and colony tech for Circle associates “Lifegiver” and “The Quartermaster” hint at new R&D and refinements yet-to-come in the evolution of the Vanguard. Whatever the future may hold for this new generation, the results of recent deployments speak for themselves.

The Scope will report on further developments as they emerge.
