# Ilash Toth
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/ilash-toth

**Ilash Toth** was an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) religious reformer, most
known for launching a doomed expedition to recover the [Ametat and Avetat](3xzaFUZ92kHBMX7jIybldm) in 21432 AD. Much information on
Toth has been suppressed by the Empire.

Teachings
---------

Toth was a radical theologian who espoused a return to the teachings of
the [Scriptures](tWsGYkfVxuvQDdt57cCUp) popular in earlier times, prior
to the launch of the [Reclaiming](70QLNGRwCwHUgmcjTmuhsA). Toth preached
that the Reclaiming had led to a shift in the faith's fundamental
message, altering it from one of quiet dignity and service to God into
something overly concerned with conquest and enslaving other races for
the benefit of those in power. The [Holders](dO9vxs4a40LrzJyoq2L8v) and the
[emperor](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ), he proclaimed, had lost sight of
the common good and were concerned only with enriching their own power,
to the detriment of both the people and their own piety.

Toth wished to dispose of the Reclaiming and free all slaves in the
Empire, including the recently-conquered
[Ealur](6TgmS6RKjOYM1Id08VBZzk). The Empire would then focus on
teaching about God and conversion by love, while the wealth of the
Holders would be used to improve the lives of every man. He envisioned a
completely egalitarian utopia where a commoner and the emperor alike
would be equal in the eyes of God, their stations differing only because
of the emperor's natural ability to rule and command.

At his height, Toth counted over a million people as followers, with
many more approving of his message if not openly following him. While
only a tiny fraction of the Amarr faith's numbers, the movement
nonetheless concerned the Church and the [Council of Apostles](nTZLcvZprqLLUiGIaVQu7). They acted in secret to
discredit him, but never openly opposed him for fear of appearing to be
tyrants.

Doomed Expedition
-----------------

Toth claimed to receive a vision from God informing him of the location
of the Ametat and Avetat, holy artifacts that had been wielded by the
first emperor, [Amash-Akura](4tm7IOIn0xaGeNFQcRl0Lc). Toth said God had
informed him the artifacts were taken away because the Empire had lost
its way, but if Toth could recover them, it would prove his message was
in the right.

A massive expedition, consisting of Toth and 50,000 followers, embarked
to recover the artifacts. The search lasted for three years, with Toth
reportedly growing closer and closer to uncovering the resting place of
the artifacts. Eventually he came to believe he was nearly at the point
of discovery and sent a tenth of his followers back to Amarr to spread
the word that the Ametat and Avetat were on their way back to the
Empire.

However, Toth and his remaining followers never returned and no trace of
them was found. The system where those followers who had returned
claimed they had left him was devoid of any indication of their fates,
with no wrecks nor evidence that Toth had ever been there. Treasure
hunters fell upon the system, but never discovered the Ametat and
Avetat.

Fate
----

The ultimate fate of Ilash Toth and his followers has been a source of
much speculation and conspiracy theory. The most commonly accepted
answer is that the expedition met with some calamity and was destroyed,
with the wreckage having long ago been picked apart and scattered. The
nature of this disaster varies from theory to theory; some claim it was
a group of pirates or raiders, others contend it was a critical engine
failure or other ship malfunction.

However, several conspiracy theories remain popular. The most widespread
theory claims the emperor, fearing that Toth would uncover the actual
artifacts, sent a covert detachment of the [navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g)
after Toth. They followed Toth to the resting place of the Ametat and
Avetat and then destroyed him before securing the artifacts for
themselves. The Ametat and Avetat, this theory claims, remain under
heavy guard in the Imperial vaults, awaiting a time when the emperor
must reveal them to save his own power.

A similar but less outlandish theory claims the emperor merely used the
expedition as a way to dispose of Toth. The theologian never discovered
the artifacts but he was still eliminated by imperial assassins. The
truth of the matter was covered up in order to prevent a public
backlash.

Still other theories claim that Toth did find the Ametat and Avetat, but
then departed with them to parts unknown, feeling that the Empire was
doomed even if he returned. The followers he sent back, it is said, were
those unworthy of following him to his new utopia.

Finally, there are some claims that Toth met with some advanced
civilization, perhaps even the [Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G), and was either
destroyed, kidnapped for research, or willingly went to live among what
he viewed as a more righteous society.

Whatever his fate, it seems unlikely the truth shall ever be uncovered.
