# Caldari Prime
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/caldari-prime

**Caldari Prime** is the homeworld of the [Civire](1lEM3yHeoK1HEpa1FrLwH5)
and [Deteis](7vixEvaBXQYC2ywT3fyAwd) people, and is located in the
[Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) system of Luminaire (which also contains
the [Gallente homeworld](41JbD6M3Keq024T44ULv7a))

Until recently the planet was claimed and occupied for almost two
centuries by the Gallente Federation, following the
[Gallente-Caldari War](1ehjby0lOpdwMJf9CprPtV). Following unprecedented,
state-wide cooperation under the leadership of
[Tibus Heth](caldari-navy), in YC 110 a massive invasion force
successfully penetrated Federation defenses and the planet was once
again claimed as a sovereign world of the Caldari State.

However in early YC 115, following a period of increasing political and
social unrest on the planet, the Federation Navy launched a major
assault against the [Caldari Navy](caldari-navy)
Leviathan-class [Titan](Titan) Shiigeru and its support
fleet, who had stayed in orbit of Caldari Prime since YC 110 to enforce
Caldari possession of the planet. The massive offensive operation to
re-conquer Caldari Prime, known as Operation Highlander, ended with the
destruction of the Shiigeru and its catastrophic fall on Caldari Prime
surface.

After the cease of the conflict Caldari Prime has been demilitarized by
both Caldari and Gallente forces, and it is now divided in districts
which are split between Caldari State and Gallente Federation
administrations, with Mordu's Legion being hired as security and
peacekeeper force on the surface.

History
-------

### Collapse

Caldari Prime was initially a barren, uninhabitable world, and the
Luminaire system was initially known only as VH-451. The planet was
purchased during the colonization of [New Eden](5m9PDmbyzmRXdP1vvQETRk), by an unidentified
[Terran](Terra) megacorporation who proceeded to initiate a
terraforming process designed to convert the inhospitable world into a
planet fit for human habitation. Small-scale colonization began soon
afterwards, consisting mostly of pioneers and of the technicians
responsible for overseeing the terraforming equipment, and their
families.

When the [EVE Gate](2z1KQXUVtPP1WmlwcJaX4o) collapsed, Caldari Prime was
cut off, and given its inhospitality towards human habitation collapsed
into a dark age very quickly. Most of the colonies died off soon,
leaving only a few scattered inhabitants left to struggle on, living
under the surface which was still under terraforming process. It took
246 years for the terraforming process to reach the point where the
planet was habitable and humans could once again venture out onto the
surface. The remains of the ancient underground structures served as
hiding places for children during the Gallente-Caldari War.

### Geography

Caldari Prime is a cold world, largely given over to tundra, with
temperate zones at the tropics and equator. This is partly due to its
being near the extreme outside edge of the Luminaire star's habitable
zone, and also because the terraforming process, without adequate human
oversight, was improperly completed, with the result that the air of
Caldari Prime is quite thin, its soil is rather barren and its seas and
wildernesses were not properly stocked with creatures and plants, many
of which were too delicate to properly survive the frigid temperatures
or incomplete ecosystem. Now, however, the planet produces food in
abundance despite its low temperature.

Notable locations include the Kaalakiota Mountains, the city of
[Arcurio](Arcurio), and the ruins of the underwater Gallente
city of [Nouvelle Rouvenor](7aF13uW1tkTLI8stM52xK).

### Civilization

The social collapse on Caldari Prime was so complete that it took
another eight thousand years after the atmosphere became breathable for
the first recorded civilization to arise. Prior to the point, the
Caldari consisted of scattered, warring tribes on separate continents
who slowly came together into allied houses. The first empires and
bloodlines grew out of these alliances, and over time these empires also
merged, eventually leading to the formation of the Raata Empire in the
year 17453 AD. This empire lasted until 20998 when it collapsed and
split into a number of smaller states that were the foundations for the
modern Caldari megacorporations.

First contact with the Gallente occurred in 22517 AD, although they had
been aware of the (at the time) less technologically advanced Caldari
for fifty-four years prior to that point. The Gallente "[Cultural
Deliverance Society](cultural-deliverance-society)" finally
arrived on Caldari Prime one hundred and fourteen years later. When the
Gallente Federation was founded in 23121, the Caldari were founding
members.

The War
-------

### Buildup

The Caldari never wholly clicked with Gallente government. Even when
they were co-founding the Federation alongside the Gallente,
[Intaki](5DUTZnySsYNmzbNQVPGXZn) and [Mannar](4BaMCkOwYaPpd4ZMtEfEY), some of the
Caldari [megacorporations](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy#megacorporations) were
establishing secret colonies and deep-space resources outside of
Federation borders that weren't subject to Gallente trade regulations.
The Caldari viewed this as part of the process of retaining their
cultural identity and autonomy.

When the Caldari extraterritorial assets were, as was inevitable,
discovered the Gallente demanded that the Caldari assets be placed under
Federation control. The Caldari responded by seceding from the
Federation. The result was a tense standoff, with Caldari warships
blockading all of the [stargates](416pCzXGIwn2Tt7feZYSpk) that had been
built by the mega corporations. The Gallente government spent several
days debating how to negotiate a peace settlement.

Peace was not given a chance, however. A Caldari extremist organization
known as the [Templis Dragonaurs](templis-dragonaurs) finally
set light to the powder keg when they bombed the city of Nouvelle
Rouvenor. This city, constructed inside an environment dome deep
underwater, was especially vulnerable to this sort of attack. When the
sea waters flooded in through the breached dome, they claimed the lives
of more than half a million people.

### Evacuation

The immediate response was for the Gallente to initiate an invasion of
Caldari Prime, beginning with a sustained orbital bombardment. Massively
outnumbered, the Caldari had no hope of holding on to their homeworld.
Evacuating the civilian population required the Caldari to hold the
orbit of their planet for a month.

Earning that month required that the Caldari Navy be able to keep the
Gallente out of the homeworld's orbit and engaged elsewhere. The result
was a month-long and bloody fight for the orbit of Caldari Prime, that
ultimately came to an end with the heroic sacrifice of Admiral [Yakiya
Tovil-Toba](RsUoECrk1bkV0t35D4sDE) in what became known to the
Gallente as the "Hueromont Incident". The Caldari completed their
objectives for the evacuation of their homeworld, but could not
ultimately consider themselves successful - they were still forced to
leave, and would not return for nearly two hundred years.

The war endured for another eighty years after the evacuation of Caldari
Prime.

[Capsuleer](15umOALoFBZxVS2oaggvJQ) Era
-------------------------------------

Pilot [capsules](capsule-(lore)) were actually a direct
product of the war, and initially used exclusively by the Caldari Navy
in battle against the Federation. The technology only became widespread
in [YC105](Year-YC105), however, more than ninety years after
the end of the war.

### Gallente Occupancy

From the end of the evacuation through until
[YC110](Year-YC110) (AD.23346), Caldari Prime was part of the
Gallente Federation, with a population demographic increasingly made up
of largely of Gallente and smaller native Caldari population. This was
always an uneasy arrangement, and Caldari Prime remained a segregated
world, with distinct districts for each culture, and even whole cities
where one ethnicity or the other were in the considerable minority.

After the war ended, the continued occupation of the planet became a
significant bone of contention for the Caldari, many of whom felt that
the homeworld should be returned to them. The Federation, wary of
allowing their former bitter enemies a potential foothold in the capital
system never agreed to this point of view, and continued to claim the
planet as their own.

Up until the rise of [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG), the possible
reclamation of their homeworld was at most a distant, impossible fantasy
for the Caldari. Heth's rise, accompanied as it was by a surge of ethnic
violence on Caldari Prime, prompted [President](president)
[Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) to declare a state of
martial law on Caldari Prime. The enforced curfew resulted in increased
levels of segregation among the planet's inhabitants.

### Invasion

In YC110, Tibus Heth seized the opportunity created by the Elder attack
on the [CONCORD](5DPzMesjfj3XKshPWBUPWt) Headquarters in Yulai to initiate a
massive invasion of the Federation with single-minded intent - the
recapture of Caldari Prime. Heth committed 90% of the Caldari Navy to
the invasion. Assisted by the sabotage of the Federation's "Tripwire"
border monitoring system, the treason of [Anvent
Eturrer](4ft267N4XjELE5by1uHCt5), and the proximity of Luminaire to
the Caldari border (a mere two jumps), the massive invasion force was
pretty much guaranteed to succeed.

With a total of twenty million soldiers committed the ground invasion,
and the Luminaire system emptied of Federation warships and every
entrance point thoroughly blockaded, the recapture of the planet was
swift and ruthless, though by most accounts the invading Caldari forces
did their best to spare civilians of both races.

The martial law and resultant separation of the Gallente and Caldari
populace into separate districts made it very easy for Heth to twist
President Foiritain's arm. Faced with the deaths of every Gallente on
Caldari Prime and maybe on Gallente Prime as well, Foiritain relented
and used the presidential emergency powers given to him by the
Federation Senate to ratify the Federation's surrender of Caldari Prime
to the control of the State. Under Foiritain's orders, the Caldari fleet
was allowed to withdraw, leaving a single Leviathan-class titan, the
Shiigeru, and its support fleet in orbit over the planet.

### Caldari Sovereignty

Caldari Prime was a bubble of Caldari territory inside Federation space
for five years. Foiritan's signing of the treaty that handed the world
back to the State has been alternately hailed as the best possible
decision in a bad situation, and viciously criticized as being
"spineless".

The planet was under occupation by the State's forces, with the
occupying forces consisting mostly of State Army regulars, supplemented
by [Provist](Caldari-Providence-Directorate) auxiliaries.
Naturally, there was a significant resistance movement - either Gallente
military who refuse to surrender, or rebellious civilians unwilling to
take their home's change of ownership lying down. The most notable of
these movements was the Joint Resistance Movement. The Caldari were
forced to take extreme measures for dealing with these dissidents.

### Operation Highlander

From 15 March YC 115 a new period of unrest started on Caldari Prime,
leading to the destruction of Provist headquarters on the 18 March and
subsequently to the Battle of Caldari Prime.

On the morning of March 22 the Federation Combined Armed Forces launched
their largest military offensive since the bombardment of Caldari Prime
over a century earlier, facing off against the Shiigeru and her support
fleet in an eight-hour battle that saw millions of casualties and the
first large-scale military use of cloned soldier technology, as
thousands of cloned mercenaries fought on both fronts.

Deploying a capital assault force of Nyx-class supercarriers and
Moros-class dreadnoughts, the Federation forces were considerably aided
by capsuleer supporters. While the Shiigeru and its escorts were
supported by Caldari loyalist capsuleers, the attacking forces proved
too strong and the titan was destroyed. Large sections of the titan's
superstructure impacted on the surface of Caldari Prime, causing
widespread destruction.

On Caldari Prime itself, clone mercenaries fought fiercely for both the
Caldari and Gallente ground forces. Caldari forces were able to hold a
slight majority of the planetary surface, a major factor in the
subsequent demilitarization and division of the planet between Caldari
and Gallente administrations.

Soon after the catastrophic impact of Shiigeru's remains with the
surface, [Ishukone](ishukone-corporation) asked permission to
the Gallente Senate to access the planet for relief purposes, permission
that was granted soon after, and played an important role for the
subsequent diplomatic efforts of ceasing the conflict still ongoing on
the surface.

### Demilitarisation of the planet

On April 2 YC 115 an agreement between the Gallente Federation and the
Caldari State was signed by [President](president) [JacusRoden]
(jacus-roden) and six of the eight CEOs of the [Chief
Executive Panel](5OC2T1uqCSy4NUPhhpq9Xr). Despite both Tibus
Heth and [Lai Dai](Lai-Dai) CEO Alakoni Ishanoya refused to
sign, the bylaws of the CEP de facto bound all megacorporations to
respect the agreement. The agreement classified Caldari Prime as a
demilitarized zone, prompting both Gallente Federation and Caldari State
to call off every military operation on the planet and granting all
defence and policing duties of the planet to [Mordu's
Legion](Mordu's-Legion). The surface has been divided into a
number of districts that has been split between Gallente and Caldari
administration. Roughly fifty-four percent of the districts fall under
the Caldari jurisdiction of the Ishukone Corporation, while forty-six
percent are Gallente districts administered by Material Acquisition. The
districts are purely administrative and are not segregated by ethnicity.

Inhabitants of the Gallente districts are considered full citizens of
the Federation and fall under all laws that previously applied to
Caldari Prime before the Caldari invasion. The Caldari districts are
under a more convoluted system, with individuals retaining corporate
citizenship with their megacorporate employers, though Ishukone collects
administrative taxes and apply their corporate law for civilian
activities. According to the terms of the treaty, Caldari Prime's two
largest cities, Arcurio and Tovil, are split between the two sides.
Tovil falls under Caldari administration, while Arcurio has been placed
within a Gallente district.
