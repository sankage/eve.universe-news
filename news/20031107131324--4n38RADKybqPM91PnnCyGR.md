The Federal Senate today agreed to lodge a formal inquiry into the scandal surrounding the recent revelations that the popular Protein Delicacies are actually made of organic waste, second grade biomass and station sewage. The inquiry will look into how Sukuuvestaa Corporation managed to conceal this fact, especially from the health organizations responsible for approving the product as suitable for human consumption. It is widely believed that at the bottom of this matter lies an even bigger scandal â€“ corruption and bribery that cut to the core of the consumer economy. The inquiry will be conducted with all due haste, so that the public can be informed as soon as possible on what exactly is going on.
