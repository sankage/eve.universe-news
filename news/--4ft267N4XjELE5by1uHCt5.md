# Anvent Eturrer
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/anvent-eturrer

Anvent Eturrer was a [Gallente](4bufc5OaK80rlo20Pez6gK) former Grand
Admiral of the [Federation Navy](y2DAUzy3B6kc7fBww7nl1). Eturrer is
most notorious for an act that earned him the nickname "The Great
Traitor" when he unwittingly aided the [Caldari State](7unGNsrMFwIWXMMbrM2jfy) in invading the Federation and
recapturing [Caldari Prime](1yEhptNaSoG42YRSay711i).

Relationship with the Broker
----------------------------

Eturrer's history prior to his participation in the Caldari invasion are
currently unchronicled. Some time prior to the rise of [Tibus Heth](6E1MZyo3l7DscBmmOdp7KG), Eturrer began selling information to [the Broker](35XiT6V98vAeV9AdpZyl72). One piece of this information caused the
Tripwire system to fail, allowing the Caldari to strike the Gallente
Federation unawares and eventually to occupy Caldari Prime. Originally,
then-President [Souro Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) assumed
Eturrer was merely incompetent and fired him, at which point Eturrer
fled the Federation. It was only later that he discovered Eturrer had
actually been traitorous. In the Caldari State, he was viewed as a hero.

After the betrayal
------------------

### Flight

Following his dismissal, Eturrer went into hiding in the [Amarr Empire](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo), where he was given sanctuary by [Uriam Kador](7LJKelrqDXAAUYi6o48Uno), Heir of the [Kador Family](3ium7VluTCFnGS0TqpinlO). Despite several attempts by the
Federation to locate and capture Eturrer, he always remained one step
ahead of Federation forces. However, following Kador's invasion of
Solitude, [Empress](3Akx6UWUOJM90aQeaPgDtJ)
[Jamyl I](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L) allowed Federation warships to enter
Empire space in order to retrieve him.

### Capture and execution

During his capture, he was not physically tortured, though he was denied
sleep and made generally uncomfortable. He was eventually transported to
Gallente Prime to be executed at a huge public rally.

During the rally, Eturrer was brought out onto a podium a good distance
from President [Foiritan](37ecuyyUNrWqNAzxwC5Wbt) and [Mentas Blaque](1bZzUGejHEhyHp6LVUtjBT) as to avoid any association between
them. Eturrer appeared disoriented during the proceedings, with a
distant and glassy look as President Foiritan delivered a fiery speech.
When offered the chance to speak in his defense, he exchanged a
momentary glance of understanding with Foiritan, then simply grinned and
dropped the offered microphone. Foiritan then revealed Eturrer had been
injected with a chemical agent that immolated when exposed to sound of a
specific frequency. When prompted, the crowd unleashed screams and yells
that were converted into the proper frequency, causing Eturrer's body to
be gruesomely destroyed. Eturrer howled in pain during the process, but
his screams were drowned out by the noise from the crowd.
