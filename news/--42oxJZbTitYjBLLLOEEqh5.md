# Golgothan Fields
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/golgothan-fields

The **Golgothan Fields** are a bleak interstellar site of shipwrecks.

The [Minmatar rebellion](25a8Ts7aOIqgem8gcsm71N) saw many
battles, both on ground and in space. The largest of the space battles
took place in the Ennur system a few weeks after the start of the
rebellion.

The main [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) battle fleet had returned from
[Jove](6xoRWydZHCG4nplVmqXV9G) space and intended to break the power of the
rebels once and for all by sweeping through their core systems. The
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) met the Amarr with everything they had
in a fierce battle that lasted for hours. In the end the Minmatar
withdrew and the Amarr claimed victory, but the Minmatar had succeeded
in disabling or destroying the best capital ships in the Amarr fleet,
thus reducing their offensive strength dramatically.

Today the old battlefield, commonly known as Golgothan Fields, is
littered with old shipwrecks and infested with pirates that have taken
refuge in the giant hulks. They fiercely defend their base, but daring
scavengers can still sneak in and rummage around.
