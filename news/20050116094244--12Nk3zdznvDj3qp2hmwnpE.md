The Caldari gaming commission is reporting that with the upcoming finals in the COLLOSSUS race, billions are being injected into the gaming industry. Previously a floundering endeavor, the championships seem to have caught the attention of the average man.   
  
And according to one middle bureaucrat in the gaming commission, this race is the biggest event since the Amarr succession. “Everyone is excited, and when they get excited, they gamble. We haven’t seen numbers like this in decades. A lucky few will win big, but the real winner is the economy.”   
  
With an estimated 100 Billion ISK bet on the final race, it will be pivotal in feeding money back into the State economy, where it can be put to work expanding operations and furthering state goals.
