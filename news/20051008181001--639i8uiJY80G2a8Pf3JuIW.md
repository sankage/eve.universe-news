Following the successful completion of his game show “Beat the tank” at the start of the month, Vincent Aslo ran the first round of his new game this week.   
  
This latest contest, titled “Hunt the bounty” involves contestants pursuing the eccentric Aslo around a solar system with the objective of catching him and winning the ‘bounty’ a monetary prize.   
  
The first round of “Hunt the Bounty” - the latest in a series of mini-games run by the former Gallente-Television host; was won by Aranel Tinuviel who relentlessly chased Vincent Aslo across the New Caldari system last Monday. Tinuviel walked away with the two million ISK prize and Aslo’s congratulations, who went on to promise further rounds of this exiting new game in the near future.
