Many billions of isk were wagered on this year’s final of the Alliance Tournament. Most of those wagers were placed for personal gain, but Seor Engis and his [AURA] Alliance decided to make a difference in the lives of those without such deep pockets. 

“We were only a few people [in the alliance] actively watching and discussing that evening and none of us felt like making huge bets. Normally I don't bet on things I can't influence, but we agreed the winner should donate the money to charity.” 

As talk of the bet evolved, it was finally decided that the winner would receive a fully loaded industrial ship filled with “basic necessities; food, water, and some of the things that makes life worth living...” to be given to the charity of the winner’s choice. 

Seor turned over the winnings to the Sisters of Eve. When asked why he chose SoE he told us; “I've worked for the sisters before, and have involved myself in their work in the Ani constellation. Seemed like the natural choice...” 

The items donated to the Sisters of Eve are as follows: 

  * 5000 tobacco
  * 10000 quafe
  * 4500 antibiotics
  * 1000 spirits
  * 3300 oxygen
  * 7000 water
  * 19000 wheat
  * 16800 frozen food



No further information is currently available as to how the goods will be distributed.
