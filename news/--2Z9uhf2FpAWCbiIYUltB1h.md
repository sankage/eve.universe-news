# Mekhios Graveyard
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/mekhios-graveyard

The **Mekhios Graveyard** is a wreckage field containing the remains of
ships that were destroyed in the [Battle of Mekhios](5rEhukOVHPitanB5Cn5jvd), where the [Imperial Navy](3PKvXZS0iHKIgAmO9np74g) made their stand against the
[Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) Elder invasion. A battle of epic
proportions took place as both empires unleashed their ancient hatred of
one another. Legend has it that untold numbers of Minmatar patriots lost
their lives in an instant when [Jamyl Sarum](6jGpYH3ai8pLLJboHVuA3L)
herself appeared on the battlefield. The question of how she could
singlehandedly repel such a vast armada remains a mystery. Rumors of a
secret superweapon abound; others swear that it was divine intervention
which turned the Minmatar invaders into dust.

A few large fragments of specific ships, such as Naglfar class
dreadnaughts, and Tempest, Apocalypse, and Armageddon class
battleships are still identifiable, but
all smaller ships were too damaged to remain identifiable. Rumors
persist that there are still survivors on some ships, but this seems
unlikely.

The graveyard can be found near the planet [Mekhios](3VOfvlm6gGI0LRutDj5MhI)
in the [Sarum Prime](uO7T7UMc6L0S8OUcHJJqP) system in the Domain
region.
