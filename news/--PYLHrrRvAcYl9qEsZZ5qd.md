# King Amarr
Published on  at https://universe.eveonline.com/new-eden-news/king-amarr

**The King** is an [Amarr](6BPFRy27fN4LnYlIyzvEwo) prisoner who lives in the
dark swamps near on a [Minmatar](1rpu7pfwTPVznAczjw2pOp) prison colony.
Some time ago he escaped the prison and went into hiding in a nearby
jungle, where he currently ekes out a spooky sort of living.

There is palpable fear and awe of him in the prison camp. He has come to
an unspoken understanding with the guards at the camp, so that prisoners
who find favor with him are spared the harshest treatment in the camp.

The catch on the prisoners' end, though, is that anyone who seeks his
favor must first realize the King exists at all - a challenge to many -
after which they must accept the chaos of the camp, and finally enter
the jungle to seek out the King out. The King himself views this as him
giving faith to the prisoners. [Prisoner 47](291ttffsRj3Ab0ZJnVmjs1) is
a typical example of someone who was lost and then realized he was
found, in the fold of the King.
